It was played by two people, either on elaborate carved and inlayed boards like the one found in Tutankhamen’s tomb, or simply scratched into the earth. The oldest known representation of Senet is in a painting from the tomb of Hesy, from 2686 BC.</p> <p>Many actual boards, with their counters and throw sticks (or “knucklebones”) have survived intact, but the rules of the game are not fully understood, there have been a number of attempts to reconstruct the game.</p> <p>senetpaintingThe game board had thirty squares laid out in three rows of ten. Some of the squares had symbols on them and the path of the counters probably followed a reversed S across the board. Ancient Egyptian Game of Senet The symbols represented ether good or bad fortune, and affected the play accordingly.</p> <p>The movement of the counters was decided by throwing four two-sided sticks or, in some cases, knucklebones. Senet, means “passing” and had a religious significance – the aim of each player being to move their pieces around the board and avoiding hazards.</p> <p>Good luck was a blessing from the gods and the winner was the first to pass into the afterlife by getting all their pieces off the board.</p> <p>With colourful -graphics and fun sound effects this reconstructed version of Senet is not only a game of chance, a bit of skill and strategy is also required.</p> <p>Senet or (senat) may be the oldest board game in the world. The oldest hieroglyphics displaying a senet game date back to 3100 BC. Senet is a two game player where each player has 5 pieces. The object of senet is to be the first player to get all your pieces off the board.</p> <p>1 Move through the board. In Senet, you play on a board consisting of 30 squares, referred to as houses. The houses are arranged in 3 rows, with 10 houses in each row. The object of the game is to move through the board, eventually getting all your pieces off the board.[1] To move, you move your pieces down the first row. Once you reach the end of the first row, you turn a corner and proceed the opposite way down the second row.[2] Once you reach the end of the second row, you once again turn a corner. You then proceed the opposite way down the third row. Once you reach the end of the third row, you move your piece off the board.[3] The number of squares you move at a time is based on how you throw the senet sticks.</p> <p>2 Use senet sticks. Senet does not use dice like a traditional board game. Instead, senet uses what are called senet sticks. These are usually popsicle sticks with one side painted black and the other painted in a different, brighter color. When it’s your turn, you’ll throw the sticks in the air. How many sticks land with the black side facing up determines your move. If you have three black sides and one color side, you can move one house and toss again.[4] If you have two color sides and two black sides, you move two houses and then lose your turn.[5] If you have three color sides and one black side, you move three houses and lose your turn.[6] Four color sides means you move four houses and toss again.[7] Four black sides means you move 5 houses and toss again.[8]</p> <p>3 Play with 5 game pieces. Senet is a two player game. Each player gets 5 game pieces at the beginning of senet. You must move all these pieces off the board in order to win. Pieces are usually rocks but you can also use pennies or other coins. Any small, movable object can be used on a senet board.[9]</p> <p>4 Read the basic rules. There are some basic rules when it comes to playing Senet. You should familiarize yourself with these rules before beginning the game. Only one piece can be placed in each house at a time. At the beginning of the game, you must place your pieces on the first row. Player 1 will place his or her pieces on the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth houses. Player 2 will place his or her pieces on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth houses.[10]</p> <p>1 Capture and protect houses. As only one piece can occupy a house at a time, you will sometimes be in a situation where a house is blocked by another player. There are ways to capture blocked houses when playing Senet. There are also ways to protect your own pieces. If you land your move on a house occupied by another player, you can capture the piece. The other player’s piece will be moved back to the house your piece was on at the beginning of your turn.[11] However, if two or more of another player’s pieces are next to each other, that house is protected. It cannot be captured and you will not be able to complete your turn.[12]</p> <p>2 Follow the special rules for houses with pictures. On a senet board, there are six houses with special pictures on them. If you land on one of these houses, there are special rules you have to follow. The House of Happiness or Pretty House is marked by what looks like three upside down stick figures. All of your pieces need to pass through this house to win. You must land on the house exactly. If, for example, the House of Happiness is located on square 26 and you’re on square 25, if you do not roll in such a way that you’ll move exactly one house you have to stay in place until your next turn.[13] The House of Water is marked by three zigzagged lines. If you land on the House of Water, you have to move straight back to the House of Rebirth. The House of Rebirth is marked by three sideways stick figures. Your piece remains on the House of Rebirth until you choose to remove it again.[14] The House of Three Truths is marked by a drawing of three birds. If you land on this house, you can throw your sticks again. If you have three color sides up, you can automatically remove this piece from the board.[15] The House of Re-Atoum is marked by two dancing stick figures. If you have land here, throw your sticks again. If you have two colored sticks facing up, you can remove your piece from the board.[16] The last house on the board is marked by a leaf-like drawing. When you reach this house, you must toss your sticks again. You cannot remove your piece until you toss your sticks and only one colored stick is facing upwards.[17]</p> <p>3 Win the game. The object of senet is to move all your pieces off the board. The first player to do so wins.[18]</p> <p>Board games were very common in ancient Egypt and people from all levels of society played them. Many game boards from ancient Egypt have been found by archaeologists. However, the rules explaining how to play these games have not survived. By studying game boards and other evidence, experts have made some educated guesses about how these games were played.</p> <p>Throw the sticks to see how many squares to move your piece forward. If you throw a one, four, or six, you get an extra turn. You can’t land on one of your own pieces. If you land on the other player’s piece, you switch places with them. However, you can’t switch with them if they have two or more pieces in a row. If the other player has three or more pieces in a row, you can’t pass them. Some squares are ‘safe’ squares and some are ‘danger’ squares. You will learn what they are as you play. The first player to get all of their pieces off the board wins the game.</p> <p>The Game of Senet</p> <p>Article by Catherine Soubeyrand.</p> <p>Senet is an Egyptian race game and may be the ancestor of our modern backgammon. We know of this game through ancient Egyption boards that have survived to this day. More than 40 have been discovered, some in very good condition with pawns, sticks or knucklebones still intact. The oldest known representation of Senet is in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (Third Dynasty circa 2686-2613 BCE).</p> <p>The game board is composed of 30 squares: 3 rows of 10 squares each. If we number each square, the board can be represented like this:</p> <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 The path of the pawns probably followed a reversed S across the board.</p> <p>Squares 26 to 30 have symbols on them. We will represent them in order by X, O, III, II and I. It seems that the square with an X, carrying the sign nfr, was beneficial, whereas the one with an O, associated with water, had a negative meaning. Square 15, also called the “square of Rebirth,” might have been the starting square.</p> <p>Other elements found with the gameboards were pawns. The Hesy painting shows a game with seven pawns for each player. Then, some time after 1600 - 1500 BCE, the players were represented with seven or five pawns. Some games have even been found with ten pawns per player.</p> <p>The movement of pawns was probably decided by the throw of four, two-sided sticks (as depicted in the Hesy painting) or, later, knucklebones might have been used to determine the moves.</p> <p>What was the function of Senet? A game or something more? In his book, Lhôte notices that the first pictures show two human players whereas later the human player is depicted alone with an invisible opponent. It appears that Senet began as a simple game and later acquired a symbolic, ritual function.</p> <p>Of course, the original rules of Senet are not known. No record of the rules on papyrus or tomb wall has ever been discovered. It is very difficult to reconstruct the game through the pieces and the tomb images.</p> <p>Kendall’s Rules</p> <p>A summary of Timothy Kendall’s work on the reconstruction of the rules of Senet is given in the book by Lhôte.</p> <p>At the beginning of the game the seven pawns per player alternate along the 14 first squares. The starting square is counted as the 15th. In the oldest games this square featured an ankh, a “life” symbol. The pawns move according to the throw of four sticks or, later, one or two knucklebones. When using the sticks the points seemed to have been counted from 1 to 5: 1 point for each side without a mark and 5 points if the four marked sides were present together. When a pawn reached a square already occupied by an opponent pawn, they have to exchange their positions. The special squares have the following effects on play: 15 : House of Rebirth, starting square and the return square for the pawns reaching square number 27. 26 : House of Happiness, a mandatory square for all the pawns. 27: House of Water, a square that can be reached by the pawns located on squares 28 to 30 which moved back when their throws did not allow them to exit the board. They have to restart from square 15. 28 : House of the Three Truths, a pawn may only leave when a 3 is thrown. 29 : House of the Re-Atoum, a pawn may only leave when a 2 is thrown. The winner is the first to move all of their pawns off the board. Bell’s Rules</p> <p>Another version of the rules was proposed by RC Bell.</p> <p>Each player has 10 pawns. Four two-sided sticks (one side painted) are thrown to determine movement.</p> <p>When only one painted side is visible : 1 point. With two : 2 points. With three : 3 points. With four : 4 points. With none : 5 points. At the beginning of the game there are no pawns on the board. Each player in turn throws the sticks, and puts his pawns on the board on the squares with the symbols I, II, III, X, O according to the number of points thrown. Only one pawn may be present on each square. So if a pawn is already present the turn is lost. A player may either move one pawn or add a new pawn to the board, if possible, with each throw. The pawns located on the marked squares are in shelters. Pawns may not be stacked. When a pawn arrives on a square already occupied by an opponent pawn, the opponent is removed and must restart from the beginning. This rule does not apply for the marked squares which are shelters. The first pawn to reach square number 1 earns a bonus of five points and it fixes the goal of the game: that player’s other pawns have to reach odd squares whereas the opponent must reach the even squares. The game ends when the pawns of the two players are alternately placed on the first and second rows. When a pawn has reached its last square, it cannot be attacked. The first player to have put all his pawns on his own squares wins the game and earns 10 points. He also gets one point for each move his opponent makes while placing all of his remaining pawns.

The pieces were moved along the board by throwing a dice or throwing sticks that would depict the number of squares the piece was to be moved.

History of senet</p> <p>Senet is known to have existed in fourth millennia, pre-Dynastic Egypt and appears to be the most popular game played. It is shown in reliefs and paintings on tomb walls; listed amongst offerings to the dead; and found as part of the funerary items in tombs. In this way senet is found more often than any other board game in Ancient Egypt.</p> <p>The oldest known representation of Senet is a painting in the tomb of Hesy, dated 2686 BCE. It was played through-out the history of Egypt up until 300 AD. With the advent of the Christian era it was seen as associated with pagan beliefs and so, it’s popularity waned.</p> <p>Senet was not only played in Ancient Egypt but was also played in Cyprus, Crete and Greece; and areas of the Middle East. In fact, a form of senet is still played today in parts of the Middle East.</p> <p>Who played senet?</p> <p>All classes of Ancient Egyptian society played senet, from the common labourer, who no doubt drew the graffiti versions found on walls, right up to the Pharaoh himself. In the tomb of Tutankhamun, New Kingdom, four beautifully crafted wooden senet boards were found with their accompanying playing pieces and throwing sticks.</p> <p>In the fifth Dynasty the game is depicted on tomb walls with two living people playing, while the deceased tomb owner stands nearby watching. Later, in the sixth Dynasty, the game is shown being played between a living person and the deceased. In other depictions the game is shown with only one person playing it.</p> <p>Why did people play senet?</p> <p>Senet was always played from its very inception to its demise as a game of entertainment and relaxation. However, early on in its history the playing of the game began to take on religious and mystical connotations.</p> <p>As already mention, in the sixth Dynasty the deceased was depicted playing a game of senet with a living person. In this way it is understood that Senet was used as a form of communication between the living and the dead. Many senet boards were found around and inside tombs were family and friends would visit the tomb and play the game to communicate with the departed soul.</p> <p>Playing the game of senet is mentioned in the coffin texts and the book of the dead. Both of these provide spells and instructions for the soul to travel safely through the underworld known as Am Duat. It is from these hieroglyphic texts as well as depictions of the game on the tomb walls that we can see the more religious and mystical connotations of the game.</p> <p>Playing the game also represented the journey of the ba to and from the tomb. The Ancient Egyptians believed that the personality of the dead manifested as a bird with a human head; this was called the ba. At sunrise the ba would leave the tomb and join with the sun God Re to travel in his solar barge across the sky. When the sun reached the west at sunset the ba had to return to the tomb. Failure to return meant spiritual death to the deceased. It was believed Re had many enemies who would attempt to destroy the ba on its journey to and from Re. In depictions were people are seen playing alone it is understood that they are either playing with their own soul; a spirit that sought to destroy the ba; or with the deceased. By winning the game they ensured the safe journey of their own ba.</p> <p>It was also believed that the soul of the dead would unit with Re as he travelled in his solar barge through the sky and then through the underworld and by this gain eternal life. In this way another purpose for playing the game was the belief that the player could unit with the Re. This not only applied to the dead but also to the living and would ensure eternal life for both the living and the dead.</p> <p>In the New Kingdom a hieroglyphic text called The Great Game appeared along with senet boards that had all thirty squares depicting symbols of Gods or religious concepts. The Great Game text depicted the journey of the God Re as the journey of the playing pieces across the game board. In this text and using these elaborate boards it is understood that the player symbolically made the journey through the underworld. On winning the game it was believed the player had successfully navigated the many dangers of the underworld and would then be able at death to travel easily through Am duat.</p> <p>There is also some indication that senet was played in the temples of various Gods and was used as part of a priests induction into the priesthood. However, little is known about the secretive ceremony of priestly induction and so what exactly happened may not have been written down, or at least had not been discovered at this time.</p> <p>This is part of an ongoing series called “Unwrapping the Secrets of Egypt.” The idea is to uncover secrets and bring ancient knowledge to life once again.

We have access to television, books (and e-books), video games, and the vastness of the internet which offers endless cat videos and Netflix. There is never a shortage of options when it comes to filling in spare time, but what would you do if you were living in Ancient Egypt, where there was no technology to keep you entertained?</p> <p>For those of you who enjoy playing board games in your spare time today, have no fear! Ancient Egyptians had a very popular board game, called senet, which was played as early as 3,100 B.C. The name senet translates to “game of passing” – the goal of the game is to move all of your pieces safely along the board towards the end, and eventually remove your pieces from play before your opponent does; it’s a race.</p> <p>The boards are set up with three rows of ten squares, which are numbered one through 30. Each player has either seven or ten pawn pieces (depending on the set of rules being used), which are moved by tossing four different two-sided sticks into the air – they are marked with numbers that determine how many spaces you can move each turn. In later years, these sticks were replaced with knucklebones to determine a player’s movement.</p> <p>While over 40 senet boards have been discovered, many still with their original pawns, sticks and knucklebones still intact, no firm set of rules has been found with them. After studying the boards themselves, along with the pieces and inscriptions of the game found in hieroglyphics, two researchers have put forward what they believe to be the rules. Both sets of rules follow the same basic ideas, but still have a few differences.</p> <p>The first set of rules was developed by Timothy Kendall. His rules indicate that each player has seven pawns, which, at the start of the game, are set up alternating along the first 14 squares. The starting square is considered to be the fifteen, which features an ankh. If pawns reach a square that is already occupied, then the pieces switch positions.</p> <p>Kendall’s rules also enforce the following rules on squares marked with certain images:</p> <p>· Square 15: House of Rebirth, the starting square, and where pawns move back to after landing on square 27. It has an image of an ankh.</p> <p>· Square 26: House of Happiness, all pawns must land on this square during play. It has an image of a bird.</p> <p>· Square 27: House of Water, all pawns must move back to the starting square if they land here. It has an image of three waves.</p> <p>· Square 28: House of Three Truths, if a pawn lands here it can only move forward if a three is thrown. It has an image of three circles.</p> <p>· Square 29: House of Re-Atoum, if a pawn lands here it can only move forward (and off the board), if a three is thrown. It has an image of an eye.</p> <p>The second set of rules was developed by R.C. Bell. If following these rules, each player is given ten pawns, which start in position off the board. The goal under these rules is to have pawns on specific squares on the board, not to move the pawns through the board and eventually off the end. If a pawn lands on a square that is already occupied, the opponent’s pawn must move back to the start of the game. Bell’s rules do not enforce any additional rules for the squares bearing images.</p> <p>Senet boards were made from a variety of materials, which often reflected the social classes of whoever was playing. Boards that have been discovered range from being simple clay tablets, to the elaborate board that was found in King Tut’s tomb, which was made of ebony, ivory, lapis and gold.</p> <p>There is a replica of King Tut’s senet board, along with its pawns, currently on display in the Unwrapping Egypt exhibition.</p> <p>Senet (or Senat[1]) is a board game from ancient Egypt. The oldest hieroglyph resembling a senet game dates to around 3100 BC.[2] The full name of the game in Egyptian is thought to have been zn.t n.t ḥˁb, meaning the “game of passing”.[3]</p> <p>Senet is one of the oldest known board games. Fragmentary boards that could be senet have been found in First Dynasty burials in Egypt,[2] c. 3100 BC. A hieroglyph resembling a senet board appears in the tomb of Merknera (3300–2700 BC).[4] The first unequivocal painting of this ancient game is from the Third Dynasty tomb of Hesy (c. 2686–2613 BC). People are depicted playing senet in a painting in the tomb of Rashepes, as well as from other tombs of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (c. 2500 BC).[5] The oldest intact senet boards date to the Middle Kingdom, but graffiti on Fifth and Sixth Dynasty monuments could date as early as the Old Kingdom.[3]</p> <p>At least by the time of the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550–1077 BC), senet was conceived as a representation of the journey of the ka to the afterlife. This connection is made in the Great Game Text, which appears in a number of papyri, as well as the appearance of markings of religious significance on senet boards themselves. The game is also referred to in Chapter XVII of the Book of the Dead.[6]</p> <p>Senet also was played by people in neighboring cultures, and it probably came to those places through trade relationships between Egyptians and local peoples.[7] It has been found in the Levant at sites such as Arad[8] and Byblos, as well as in Cyprus.[9] Because of the local practice of making games out of stone, there are more senet games that have been found in Cyprus than have been found in Egypt.[10]</p> <p>The senet gameboard is a grid of 30 squares, arranged in three rows of ten. A senet board has two sets of pawns (at least five of each). Although details of the original game rules are a subject of some conjecture, senet historians Timothy Kendall and R. C. Bell have made their own reconstructions of the game.[11] These rules are based on snippets of texts that span over a thousand years, over which time gameplay is likely to have changed. Therefore, it is unlikely these rules reflect the actual course of ancient Egyptian gameplay.[7] Their rules have been adopted by sellers of modern senet sets.</p> <p>For three consecutive days, the skies were misting, the sogginess settling over our spring break plans like a dew-soaked sleeping bag. Instead of camping, my children whiled away the days rolling dice, moving pawns and crafting victory plots – all while enjoying the vistas of our living room. Although the rain brought a sting of disappointment, it also lent a lovely haze that, like a soft-focus lens, made even this ordinary scene a bit more satisfying.</p> <p>They may be playing board games for fun (or at least to pass the time), but this wasn’t always the case for players of one ancient game. Senet, which originated in Egypt more than 5,000 years ago, carried such cultural and religious significance that it was often entombed with the dead. And it’s no wonder: The outcome of a Senet game may have meant the difference between annihilation in the underworld and everlasting life with the gods.</p> <p>Even the game’s name centers on a dual meaning; the word means “passing,” and as they play, competitors strive to pass their opponents and pass their pieces off the board, thus winning the game – or signaling their personal entry into a comfortable afterlife.</p> <p>Although Senet was played for thousands of years, it fell out of fashion sometime after 400 A.D. – and the rules were never written down. For decades, Egyptologists and other experts have attempted to reconstruct the game’s intricate rules, as well as the nuanced meanings of its board symbols. Most agree the object is to be the first of two players to race the game’s pieces along an S-shaped path to the final square on the rectangular board.</p> <p>Senet may be the forerunner of several modern games, including Backgammon and Parcheesi, whose rules are cut of similar cloth. In Backgammon, for example, a player competes to move his checkers to a home quadrant and then off the board faster than his opponent. And in Parcheesi (which stems from the original Indian classic Pachisi), players attempt to block their opponent’s game pieces as they strive to place their own in safe squares on the game board, all while racing to the finish.</p> <p>This Senet box from 1978 reproduces an ancient Egyptian wall painting.

XX (ca. 1250-1100 B.C.).” See more pictures of toys and games. AVEDON GAMES COLLECTION, COURTESY CANADIAN MUSEUM OF CIVILIZATION</p> <p>The History of Senet PREV NEXT<br /> Just as many of today’s most popular games include a board and movable pieces – and require a generous helping of luck – so does the ancient game of Senet. Although Senet debuted long before there were game awards (or a game industry, for that matter), it surely deserves recognition for its appeal to players of all ages throughout the ages.</p> <p>What may have begun as a visual way to mark each of the 30 days in the Egyptian month evolved into an entertaining game and then into one with serious cultural and religious significance.</p> <p>The earliest Senet boards that we have evidence of date as far back as 3500 B.C. and were rectangular slabs of wood, limestone or faience (ceramic earthenware made from ground quartz and coated with a brightly colored glaze) that were carved with squares and symbols. By 1500 B.C., Senet games were increasingly self-contained. Many featured a board carved into or attached to the top of a rectangular box with pullout storage for the game pieces [source: Piccione].</p> <p>Although Senet game play probably didn’t change much over the years, its presentation became more elaborate. By the time of King Tutankhamen’s death in 1328 B.C., Senet game boards were at least sometimes built atop gaming tables with built-in storage and exquisitely carved legs; such a gaming table was discovered in his tomb [source: Dollinger]. Despite Senet’s royal appeal, it also appealed to the masses. Senet squares and symbols have been found atop high stone walls, most likely created by mason workers who enjoyed playing the game during breaks from building kingly tombs and other stately structures.</p> <p>Whether the property of a prince or a pauper, all Senet game boards followed a format often repeated in ancient Egyptian edifices: three rows of 10 squares each. The game included five or seven distinctive game pieces for each player, depending on the era in which it was played. The pieces were shaped like cones or spools and were known as “ab,” the Egyptian word for dancer, because they danced along the board [source: Astral Castle].</p> <p>Four sticks cut from tree branches were used as dice; they had a rounded side and a flat side. Here’s a movement guide:</p> <p>One stick with flat side up = one spaces Two sticks with flat sides up = two spaces Three sticks with flat sides up = three spaces Four sticks with flat sides up = four spaces Four sticks with flat sides down = six spaces</p> <p>How to Play Senet PREV NEXT<br /> Just how complex can a 5,000-year-old game played with sticks become? Senet may surprise you. From the etchings on the game board to the fact that it’s not possible to cast a five with the sticks, Senet is a game imbued with the symbolic. For the ancient Egyptians, five was a mystical number that denoted the five elements that compose each person, and each of the etched squares is believed to represent a religious concept. (We’ll explore Senet game squares in more detail on the next page.)</p> <p>Although records of Senet’s original rules have never been recovered, much of the game’s play has been reconstructed based on unearthed sets, images wrought on tomb walls, and the study of Egyptian culture and religion. According to a version of the rules researched and developed by archeologist Timothy Kendall, players begin the game by placing their pieces in alternating spaces to fill the first 14 squares on the board. Thus, the 15th square is Start.</p> <p>To determine which player goes first, they take turns casting the sticks. The first to throw a one (one stick that lands with the flat side up and three that land flat-side down) makes the first move. And the second move as well: Each time a player throws a one, four or six, she goes again.</p> <p>The game pieces move in an S-shaped path, reversing direction with each row, and progressing from the square each starts on to square 30. Contestants try to move ahead of their opponents and force them backward using blocking techniques – more about that on the next page. The winner is the first to move her game pieces to the final row and then off the board [source: Soubeyrand].</p> <p>STICKS, KNUCKLEBONES AND DICE Don’t have any small lengths of cut tree branches handy? Fresh out of the kinds of knucklebones that may have eventually replaced sticks as randomizers, too? You can use craft sticks – just mark one side of each as the “flat” side. You could also buy a five-sided die from a specialty gaming retailer (you’d move six spaces if you rolled a five), or play with a single six-sided die (you’d simply re-roll without moving if you rolled a five), but either of those options would change the probability of rolling each number.</p> <p>There’s ongoing debate about the rules of Senet, as well as the exact meanings of the symbols on its board. Some ancient Senet game boards have blank squares, while others feature ornate symbols in every square. Despite these variations, there are five squares that have largely remained unchanged for 5,000 years. You’ll find them on the last five spaces of the board. The rules attached to them here are the ones suggested by Egyptologist Dr. Peter A. Picionne.</p> <p>Square 26, the House of Rejuvenation: Land here and you’ll receive a free turn. The square’s also a nod to mummy preparation; the place where the dead were prepared for burial and eternal life was known as “rejuvenation.” Square 27, the House of Water (also known as the Waters of Chaos): Land on this square, and you’ll not only lose a turn, but you’ll have to remove the game piece from the board. Ancient Egyptians believed the dead must gain passage on a boat to float over the deadly waters of the netherworld; otherwise, they would drown. Square 28, the House of Three Truths: A game piece may only leave this square when a three is cast. The markings on this square are believed by some Egyptologists to symbolize Thoth, a powerful god of writing, magic and science thought to have written the spells in The Book of the Dead [source: Seawright]. Square 29, the House of the Re-Atum: A game piece may only leave this square when a two is cast. Leaving this square symbolically follows the emergence of this god into a deity. Square 30, the Re-Horakty: This square signifies Re-Horakhty, the sun god who rose into the dawn, and is the most important square on the board. A game piece may only go forward from this square when a one is cast. When on the last three squares, if a player cast more than the number needed to move a piece off the board, he must move the extra number of spaces backward. For example, if a game piece is on Square 28, a player must cast a two to move the game piece to Square 30 and, subsequently, off the board. In this case, if he cast a three, the player must move the game piece forward two spaces to Square 30 and then backward one space to Square 29 to complete his turn. The first player to pass all of his game pieces over Re-Horakhty’s square and off the board wins the game – at the least. At the most, he is assured of safe passage through the netherworld and of eternal bliss in the afterlife [source: Piccione]. (More about the religious beliefs surrounding Senet later on.)</p> <p>In addition to the last five squares on the board, two other squares often held a special significance. The 15th square, which frequently depicts a frog, is thought by some experts to signify the House of Repeating Life because a frog is the ancient Egyptian symbol for resurrection. Game pieces that land on this square can take an extra turn or remain safe from attack for a turn. Landing on the 16th square, known as the House of Netting, results in the loss of turn. Egyptians believed sinners in the netherworld would become tangled in their executioners’ nets, so game pieces lose a turn to signify their torture and eventual annihilation in pits of fire [source: Astral Castle].</p> <p>Senet isn’t as straightforward as casting sticks and moving game pieces the appointed number of squares on the board. Strategy – and a bit of luck – come into play when you throw a number that would allow you to land on a square occupied by an opponent’s game piece. This attack forces the opponent’s piece to go to the spot where you came from, essentially exchanging places.</p> <p>As you progress along the board in accordance with the number you cast at the start of your turn, you can jump over an opponent’s piece or one of your own. However, you cannot put two of your own pieces on the same square; if a roll would land your piece on a space occupied by another piece of yours, you’ll have to choose another piece to move so that you can avoid this. And keep in mind that there’s an important exception to the jumping rule: If two of your opponent’s pieces are in adjacent squares, you can’t jump over the one closest to you – or attack it. When two or more of a player’s game pieces are in adjacent squares, each are protected – while this can pose a problem if an opponent manages it, it can also play right into your strategy.</p> <p>You can block another player by creating a wall of game pieces on adjacent blocks. Unless your opponent throws the exact right number to justify a multi-space leap over all your adjacent game pieces, he’ll be stuck behind them and will need to wait for your pieces to move. If your opponent is near the end of the board and must go backward on the squares to complete his turn, but cannot because a wall of your game pieces that are blocking his movement, his turn is over – even if he rolled a one, four or six [source: San Diego Museum of Man].</p> <p>Also keep in mind that a player must have all his pieces off the first row (squares one through 10) to remove any of them from the board.</p> <p>PREV NEXT<br /> This Senet board from circa 1938 to 1700 B.C. has only 21 squares.

The game of Senet may well have been invented as an entertaining way to pass the time, but as Egyptians became increasingly fascinated with the gods, it began to take on greater symbolism. By 1300 B.C., King Tut and his contemporaries probably played Senet to simulate the journey through the underworld and perhaps even to symbolically seal their own eternal fate.</p> <p>There’s evidence that ancient Egyptians believed winning a Senet game could result in a soulful union with the gods. The starting square in the upper left hand corner of the game sometimes features a bird-headed divinity, thought to announce the arrival of souls into the court of judgment and arrange their passage through the netherworld.</p> <p>As you progress through the game, you’ll symbolically sail on Re-Horakhty’s bark across the choppy waters of the netherworld and through its 12 dark regions (one for each hour of the night), where newly departed souls are judged for their sins and either reap their punishments (torture and annihilation) or rewards (food, drink and eternal life with Ra, the sun god). If you were the first to pass your ab from the board, your soul would be one of the fortunate ones; you’d be assured of your survival while sojourning through the netherworld and could rest assured that upon your death you’d rise with Re-Horakhty in the eastern sky at dawn, where you would become one with Ra. Not bad for winning a board game, right?</p> <p>This also explains why contemporary depictions of the game increasingly mirrored Senet’s value as a religious ritual rather than an entertaining pastime. Some ancient illustrations show only one person playing the game; the opponent couldn’t be seen because it was the player’s own soul [source: Piccione]. Eventually, the game itself may have transcended the necessity of play: Merely having it in one’s tomb may have been enough to secure a positive afterlife.</p> <p>Despite its religious significance and favor among the ruling classes, secular versions of Senet co-existed and were played by Egyptians of varying stations. Although the rules remained the same, the intent was vastly different; secular versions were still played recreationally.</p> <p>This Senet board from circa 1938 to 1700 B.C. has only 21 squares.

Somehow, I think this made it even more fascinating to uncover its history and follow its progression from child’s play to predictor of eternal life. Plus, I was pleasantly surprised to discover it’s actually a fun game to tackle. Not as straightforward as it seems, Senet involves a surprising amount of strategy. Up next? Crafting my very own Senet game out of cardstock. No word yet on whether I’ll be sailing or swimming through the netherworld.</p> <p>The Senet is a board game that predates all other board games in the world. It existed as early as 3000 BC to 3500 BC in burial sites from the Predynastic period and First Dynasty of Egyptian history. Relics of this well-liked game were also from the paintings found in the tomb of Merkenera (presumably between 3300 – 2700 BC), in the Third Dynasty tomb of Hesy (from 2686 to 2613 BC) and in the burial site of Rashepes (2500 BC).</p> <p>It was one of the most popular game in that time of history. It appears as rectangular board made of 30 tiles in three rows consisting of 10 tiles each. The last five tiles were drawn with hieroglyphic symbols. The game utilizes knucklebones and sticks of different colors usually tossed to the board similar to that of the modern dice. In the Old Kingdom, each player is given seven pawns as playing pieces. During the New Kingdom, the board appeared in fancier forms where only five playing pieces (sometimes made of kneeling and bound captives) were used. However, the rules of the game are subject for debate and remain to be unknown although many scholars have speculated.</p> <p>Similarly, during the New Kingdom, the senet board game has been linked to afterlife and functions as a talisman of the deceased in his journey. The game’s element of luck is often linked to the Egyptian idea of determinism making any successful player under the guidance and protection of the national deities: Ra, Thoth and Osiris.</p> <p>Because of its talisman properties, the senet boards are frequently placed in tombs. In the Book of the Dead, It is expressed that the ancient Egyptians believed that it is a protection tool for the deceased dangerous journey in afterlife. In fact, in the tomb of Tutankhamun, four senet boards have been found suggesting that it might have been his favorite game. Scholars also believed that it might have been a favorite pastime of the dead. Depictions found in the Book of the Dead show the deceased playing alone with no visible opponent. This implies that the dead may have been playing against the supernatural powers of the beyond. Winning against these unknown opponents ensured a good fortune for the player in afterlife.</p> <p>Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game similar to backgammon. Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path. Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land.. As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one’s pawns off first. A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board. Also, players may block each others’ progress as in Parchisi. Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful. Senet is one of the oldest of man’s games but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered. Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground. As a result modern man has made several educated guesses as to the rules. The most popular versions are in the files section.</p> <p>It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.</p> <p>It’s impossible to know when the first boardgame came to be, but the most ancient one we have evidence for is the game known now as Senet. According to the late R.C. Bell in The Boardgame Book, the earliest record of Senet is from a wall painting dated about 2613 BC. Ancient writers rarely seemed to bother with the mundane aspects of life, so it’s hardly surprising that we don’t have any written references that might describe how to play. What has survived are some paintings (always in profile, by Egyptian artistic conventions) and about 40 or so copies of the game in various tombs (in various degrees of completeness).</p> <p>This means we can’t be sure about how to play, but some educated guesses can and have been made and you can buy commercially made copies of the game. I have a 1998 version by Fundex Games and a nearly identical 1976 edition by Northwest Corner Inc.</p> <p>Suggested rules also appear in the Boardgame Book and in The Word of Games among other places.</p> <p>Everyone seems to agree that play moved back and forth down the 30 spaces rather like a game of Snakes &amp; Ladders. Most believe play started in the upper left corner and moved to the lower right. All also seem to agree that it’s in the backgammon family of games, and indeed, it may be the original founding game of the type. Each player had an equal number of identical pieces (either 5 or 7) and the “dice” were four throwing sticks that were flat on one side and rounded on the other.</p> <p>The board comprised 30 spaces in three rows of 10 each. 24 of the spaces were plain or decorated with art that had no game effect. If we start the numbering system at the upper left, the first special space is No. 15. This seems to be a “starting” space of some kind, according to most authorities, although probably not the game start. Instead it seems to be a restarting space for pieces that are sent back from the “water trap” in space 27, which I’ll discuss later on.</p> <p>The next space of note is No. 26, which apparently usually had a symbol implying it was a “good” space. Space No. 27 is the “water trap” which is a “bad” space. Most authorities believe that pieces that landed there were sent back to Space 15. Finally, spaces 28, 29 and 30 are marked III, II and I, respectively. Most believe these were “bearing off” spaces, although some versions treat them as entering spaces, RC Bell, for example.</p> <p>Apparently these markings were remarkably stable for the several thousand years that the game was played.</p> <p>We can’t know what the “right” rules were, of course. And it’s likely that over the course of several thousand years the rules changed a bit over time and from place to place. The rules were transmitted orally, so local variations and customs no doubt occurred. One only has to consider how many different ways there are to play checkers (draughts) and dominoes to see that the same set of game equipment can result in a lot of variation, even if the basic idea stays the same.</p> <p>All that said, I think experienced game players can make some reasonable judgments about what’s likely to have been the rules. I’m not sure that many of the Egyptologists have also been game players and some of their suggested rules don’t seem to make sense to me.</p> <p>For example, R.C. Bell’s suggested rules have the players starting off the board and trying to marshal all their pieces into a set formation on the board. I think this is highly doubtful. Other games in the class such as Backgammon, Ludos Duodecim Scriptorum and Snakes &amp; Ladders bear off, not on. I think this is a fundamental aspect of play and probably has always been so. It’s also much simpler in execution than the alternative. Finally, the pictorial evidence seems to show that pieces started on the board.</p> <p>Some sources, such as the Fundex rules, suggest that the marked spaces are simply “safe” spaces” without any further game effect. Authorities seem pretty sure that pieces that landed on an opposing piece sent the target back to where the aggressor came from. There also seems broad agreement that a pair of adjacent friendly pieces protected each other from being bumped and a row of three friendly pieces created a block that could not be passed by the opponent.</p> <p>But it seems to me that game board markings, especially those that remain stable over many centuries, certainly must have some effect on play. The III, II and I markings (and their variants, which always show three, then two and finally one thing) most likely mean that the pieces needed that exact throw to bear off. I think they were also “safe” spaces, but not just safe spaces)</p> <p>The water trap’s effect of sending pieces back to space 15 works well, adding a bit of fate and drama to the game , especially near the end. I’m not sure about the “good” space at No. 26. Walker’s rules that it’s a mandatory “stop” space that all pieces have to pause in before going further. This doesn’t seem much like a “good” effect to me and just slows down a game that’s not exactly torrid in its pace anyway. The Fundex rules merely treat it as another “safe” space, which doesn’t seem like all that much, but it’s still at least somewhat positive. The Fundex rules don’t have a roll that equals a “five” so you cannot bear off from that space, which is internally consistent, at least.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that a toss of the sticks that shows 1 flat face up allows one piece to move one space and another throw. Throws that show 2 or 3 flats allow one piece to move that number of spaces and pass the sticks to the opponent. Four flats up allows a move of four spaces and another throw.</p> <p>There’s some difference of opinion about no flats (or four round sides up). Walker and Bell suggest it’s a “five” while the Fundex rules and the Jequier rules in World of Games say it’s a “six.” Either way it also allows another throw. I think “six” is preferable because it adds a little more speed to the game. In cases when there is no legal forward move, then the value from the casting sticks has to be used for a retrograde move instead. This is possible if you are on the “safe” space just before the water trap. A six can’t bear your piece off, so you go back six instead. Bummer.</p> <p>Game play is more interesting than it might first appear from a game with such simple rules. There’s considerable scope for tactical play as the two armies claw past each other trying to exit. Forming and maintaining blocks is a big part of the game, although the water trap and the difficulty of bearing off quickly mean that it’s hard for one side to run off with the game. The Fundex 1998 rules do have an option for scoring extra points in a series of games if the opponent still has pieces in the first or second rows at game end (similar to gammoning in backgammon).</p> <p>The element of fate in the game appealed to Egyptian cultural sensitivities and the game eventually became associated with religious themes, although it always was played as a secular past time as well.</p> <p>Modern players may find the game a little too slowly paced and repetitive and some people may not like the casting sticks. They are a little louder and more harsh in the hands than what we moderns are used to. The Fundex edition includes a modern 6-sided die for players who don’t mind the anachronism.</p> <p>The clay pot theory of history</p> <p>It was hard work being dead in ancient Egypt. You had to put the hours in. Upon death, ancient Egyptians believed that your ba - soul is the closest word we have - was kicked loose from your body and freed to roam the lands. This freedom came with limitations, however. Every day your ba left the tomb where your mummy rested and wandered in the heavens. Every night, it had to work its way back home, descending with the sun god to the world of the dead and undergoing great trials, before it finally rejoined the body in an act of supreme spiritual renewal. As above, so below: the Egyptians believed that the sun was born every morning and died every evening. The ba mimicked its journey through the sky.</p> <p>In truth, being dead was pretty hard going even before you got to all of that. Take Nesperennub, Beloved of the God, Opener of the Doors of Heaven. Nesperennub was a priest and advisor to a pharaoh - possibly Osorkon 2 - and when he died in Thebes somewhere around 800 BC, the people tasked with embalming him stuck a small clay pot to the back of his head. We know this because the pot is still there, and it shows up very clearly in CT scans that Nesperennub’s mummy was subjected to in the early 2000s as part of a “virtual unwrapping” conducted by the British Museum, where the priest, and his ba, now count out their days.</p> <p>For a while after the pot was rediscovered, however, I vaguely remember reading that nobody knew exactly what it meant. The assumption, I think, was that it could be important, because Nesperennub was important. He was Opener of the Doors of Heaven. The appearance of the pot was therefore quietly troubling, I guess. No other mummy had even turned up with a pot on their head, and there was no mention of anything like it in the literature. Also, it was barely a pot if we’re all being honest: a rough-hewn object made of unfired clay, still bearing the fingerprints of its ancient manufacturer.</p> <p>Since this was Egypt, however, the smart money was on some hidden aspect of the ancients’ famously elaborate death rituals. In one article I read at the time, a symbolic placenta was mooted. But why? A soul catcher? Unlikely. The ancient Egyptians located the home of a person’s consciousness in the heart - a bad guess that has left lingering traces in many cultures to this day. They dismissed the brain entirely, calling it “the marrow of the skull” (and they weren’t alone in their confusion by any means; Aristotle thought it was a radiator). Egyptian embalmers scooped the brain out and binned it. No special treatment needed. Besides, the ba was supposed to travel. Why trap it beneath a pot?</p> <p>The truth is both more illuminating and more human than you might suspect. Let’s imagine the scene. An embalming tent in Thebes, tasked with a high-prestige job: to prepare a renowned priest for the afterlife. The mummification process would take 70 days, and was performed by experts, most of whom were priests themselves. After the internal organs were removed and the body was dried with natron (a kind of salt), aromatic resin would be applied to preserve the deceased for the aeons that lay ahead. This resin was expensive, and in Nesperennub’s case, the embalmers appear to have applied a little too much. It started to run down the back of the dead priest’s skull. And so, in order to salvage as much of the pricey stuff as possible, one of the embalmers grabbed a lump of clay and made a crude receptacle to place under Nesperennub’s head to catch it.</p> <p>5 Nesperennub, ‘Beloved of the God, Opener of the Doors of Heaven’. Then they forgot about it, for a while at least, and when the time had come to wrap Nesperennub’s skull, disaster: the resin had stuck the pot to his scalp. The embalmers made a few attempts to remove it, tearing the priest’s dried-up skin in the process, and then? Then they made the best of a bad job, sending Nesperennub into history, wrapped up and in his sarcophagus and with a clay pot on his head. Who would ever know?</p> <p>The Witcher game that never was Made in Poland but not by CD Projekt Red. The Witcher game that never was I love the clay pot story because it acts as a tunnel that leads directly to the distant past. Wander in and it shows you that we are not so different after all. The ancient Egyptians can so easily become the unknowable titans of the desert, chilly religious fanatics who thought about death a great deal and built hulking tombs of fearful symmetry. We visit their looted palaces and might assume that they too were as hollow and as echoing as these places seem to us today.</p> <p>But with Nesperennub and his humble pot, here they are all of a sudden, up close and recognisable, human-sized, hands sticky, minds flustered, frantically trying to stop a simple klutzish mistake from getting out of hand. This fleeting domestic insight into the lives of people who lived millennia ago seems so much more revealing than the high culture stuff - the pyramids, the spells, the gods. Ever since I first heard about Nesperennub and his endearingly ridiculous secret, I’ve been trying to find other similarly human glimpses into Egypt’s warm-blooded past. I’ve been looking to expand the clay pot theory of history.</p> <p>And it made me think: maybe games might provide a similar way in. Games! Suddenly, we get to see beneath the broad sweep of rulers and wars and into the lives of ordinary Egyptians. With games, we’re right there in people’s houses, playing with the draughtsmen, arguing over our fortunes and throwing little sticks to make a move (the Egyptians invented breath mints and paper and triage, but they didn’t invent dice). So it goes: some people play well and still lose every game. Some people rise to power only to end up with pots stuck to their heads.</p> <p>If I was looking for games, I knew my ultimate target: Senet, the favoured game of the ancient Egyptians, played on a board made from three neat rows of 10 spaces each. Senet was played in Egypt for over 3000 years, and was responsible for one of the first recorded instances of trash-talking, captured on the wall in the tomb of Pepi-Ankh at Meir and itself dated to around 2300 BC. Player One: It has alighted. Be happy my heart, for I shall cause you to see it taken away. Player Two: You speak as one weak of tongue, for passing is mine.</p> <p>Senet is one of the precursors of Backgammon, amongst other things. Backgammon! I have personally played this just once, on the night train from Cairo to Luxor in the late 1990s, tempted south not so much by Karnak Temple and Thebes, where Nesperennub met his sticky post-fate, but by a poetic line describing a cheap hotel in my swiftly-fragmenting travel guide: Mr Magdi will let you sleep on the roof for the price of breakfast. That sounded like the life! Footloose, but also kind of timeless. In Luxor I could be a rooftop-hopping nomad. Over the years, a little of Mr Magdi’s knockabout romance stuck to Backgammon and inevitably mixed in with Senet too. And the romance held firm until the night, a year or so ago, that I loaded up a digital version of the ancient game on Steam and started to play.</p> <p>I tried to play anyway, but there was a crucial problem. Senet didn’t seem to work particularly well as a game. Where was the drama? Where was the tactical thrill? What was I missing? Or, possibly, what were the ancients thinking when they chose this game as the one, above all others, to stick with for three millennia?</p> <p>Senet was the favoured game of the ancient Egyptians. I had read this in books for years, and, in my ignorance, it always made sense. it made sense right up to the moment I actually tried it myself - after which it seemed to hint at a great mystery.</p> <p>“I can’t even remember what made me do this.”</p> <p>Senet, or the passing game. The name is sonorous and melancholic, but it refers, rather prosaically, to the draughtsmen, which are able to pass each other as they move across the board. Senet is old. It’s older than writing - in Egypt at least. We know this because a side view of the Senet board was actually used for the hieroglyphic sign, Mn.</p> <p>The Egyptians, never the most spontaneous of ancient peoples, had a lot of time to get Senet right. The oldest surviving boards, unearthed in a First Dynasty tomb at Abu Rawash, date from around 3000 BC and the reign of King Dewen. Some people suggest it reaches as far back as 3500 BC. And forward? The last Egyptian board found was sketched on the roof of the hypostyle hall of the temple of Hathor at Dendera, and dates from the first century AD. By this point, Egypt was a province of Rome, so ancient Egypt’s favourite board game pretty much outlasted ancient Egypt.</p> <p>Some of what we know about Senet comes from the tomb of a man named Hesyre, who lived around 2660 BC. One of Hesyre’s many titles was ‘chief dentist’, according to the literature, which sounds like a pretty exhausting gig in an empire of over two million people. He was also a major game collector. His waiting room must have been a laugh riot. His tomb certainly isn’t bad, although a nasty case of plundering has left it with little that wasn’t slapped onto the walls. Still, in his resting place at North Saqqara, we see paintings of a complete Senet set, alongside paintings of complete sets for other popular games like Mehen, which was played on a board shaped like a coiled snake.</p> <p>Paintings of complete sets are important, because when it comes to physical objects, almost nothing from the ancient past makes it to us completely intact. Bones crumble. Jewelry breaks. Chessmen are swallowed by the earth. (Some were carved out of bamboo and could actually be eaten: to the victor, the spoils.) As a result, Senet’s precise rules are lost - but there have been plenty of people who have been willing to make guesses.</p> <p>Two of the most educated guesses come from the 20th century, and it’s here I initially turned in my quest to understand why the ancient Egyptians loved a game that didn’t seem to be particularly lovable. The first educated guess is by R.C. Bell, a British plastic surgeon who died in 2002, and who devoted his life to collecting and cataloguing board games from around the world. His two-volume work, Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations, is a wonder: lively, bright-eyed and practical, and filled with detailed rules and diagrams. It’s a perfect rainy afternoon book.</p> <p>No Man’s Sky guide, tips and tricks for survival All our guides, tips, tricks, and advice for getting through No Man’s Sky in once place. No Man’s Sky guide, tips and tricks for survival Bell calls Senet Senat, or The Game of Thirty Squares, and he refers to the throwsticks, which stood in for dice, as gambling sticks. He felt certain that Senet was a two-player “table” game along the lines of Backgammon, and the rules he suggests are entirely sensible. Each player places their collection of draughtsmen alternately on the first squares of the board, and the aim of the game is to make it from the start to the finish, and from there to then get all surviving pieces off the board. The board itself is treated like an s-shaped snake, so you advance left to right along the first 10 squares, and then loop around and take the next 10 squares right to left before looping back once more. Players take turns, and when somebody lands on an enemy piece, they can capture it and remove it from play. The last five squares of the board leave you safe from capture, but require exact throws to move forward from. The player guiding most pieces off the board wins.</p> <p>The first volume of Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations was published in 1960. Almost two decades after that, in the late 1970s, someone else had a go at cracking Senet. This time it was Dr Timothy Kendall, a young Egyptologist from the US. Today, Dr Kendall is rather hard to get to talk to, as he spends a large chunk of the year working at Jebel Barkal, a mountain surrounded by ruined temples and palaces in the Sudan, and a location that once marked the southern limit of the Egyptian empire.</p> <p>He is worth the effort: rigorous but sprightly, an ideal academic and thrilling company. When I contacted him out of the blue on a Thursday afternoon to propose an interview, within five minutes of picking up the phone he was quoting verses from the Egyptian Book of the Dead to me in a quavering voice. Days later, he sent me a photocopy of his booklet, Senet: The Rules of Play, which was published in 1978. In the top left corner he had written: “Hypothetical, but based on best evidence!” This was surely the man who could bring Senet back to life for me. He had done it once already.</p> <p>Dr Kendall’s rules are not dramatically different to Bell’s, but there are a few interesting alterations. Dr Kendall refers to the 30 squares as houses, and introduces a neat spatial element that makes the game a little more tactical. A single draughtsman on his own - that is, one placed in a house between two empty houses - is classed as undefended, and may be captured by another player. If two matching draughtsmen are placed together, however, they are defended, and are effectively blocking other players from landing on them.</p> <p>More importantly for the pacing of play, captured pieces are not removed from the board, but are knocked backwards, making for a game that has a little less bloodshed and a bit more pushing and shoving to it.</p> <p>Dr Kendall also has a lot to say about the final houses on the board. House 27 is the House of Waters, since it was often decorated with wavy lines in Senet boards from the New Kingdom (from the 16th century BC to the 11th century BC) onwards. A piece that lands in the water must return to house 15, which is known as the House of Repeating Life. Dr Kendall also suggests that players may continue a turn until they have thrown a two or a three, and they should complete their throws before any moves are made, opening up greater tactics, since, should you throw a four and a three, say, you could either move one piece by four houses and another by three, or move a single piece by seven houses.</p> <p>When Dr Kendall isn’t in the Sudan, he lives in Salem, Massachusetts, and it’s here that I finally catch up with him for a proper discussion on Skype one morning. His laptop camera reveals a cheerful man with busy white hair, fine-rimmed glasses, and a deceptively delicate air to him. His voice is quiet and aristocratic and he seems slightly sunburned from a recent trip abroad. A gentleman adventurer, he is the sort of man you might put behind the wheel of a Saab.</p> <p>Also: he is very surprised to be having a conversation about Senet. “It was a long time ago!” he laughs, throwing his hands up. “That was back in the late 1970s!”</p> <p>Senet, in other words, has not been his life’s work. “I can’t even remember what made me do it,” he says, after a long pause. “I guess it was the discovery that there were texts that described people playing the game, and that there was this game board that had every single square inscribed, and so you could follow the text with the game board and maybe decipher how it was played. But I mean, gosh, that’s a long time ago.”</p> <p>The God who Peter Molyneux forgot For Curiosity winner Bryan Henderson, the prize inside the cube has been anything but life-changing. The God who Peter Molyneux forgot Even so, I am struck by the thrill of this. Archaeology isn’t just about working away in the sand with a toothbrush, trying not to break something precious as you pull it out of the earth. It can be a creative, theoretical enterprise, a means of reconstructing the thought processes as well as the material culture of ancient people - a way of getting inside their minds as well as their tombs.</p> <p>“Basically, we have a certain amount of information from these texts about Senet,” Dr Kendall explains. “We know which direction the pieces moved in. We know what their objective was, they had to get on this beautiful house, and then they had to cross the water square, and then they had to get off the board. You have a certain amount of information that is absolutely proven. The question is: you know they weren’t jumping back and forth from one line to another, so it had to be a kind of competition for position on the track, the S-shaped track.”</p> <p>SORRY TO BOTHER PS4 WipEout’s classic sleeve is PSX nostalgia supreme WipEout is one of the most fondly-remembered PlayStation games around - and based on this wraparound for the upcoming WipEout Omega Collection on PlayStatio… The Fifth Element and the best way of finding out about something Somehow, twenty years have passed since the release of The Fifth Element. That means it’s been twenty years since those gentle brass aliens first wobbled in… So what next? Dr Kendall is unambiguous. “So then you have to invent a way in which the opposing pieces compete on this track. That’s the only invented thing. Because we actually know how the throwsticks were used to move the game along.”</p> <p>I ask Dr Kendall if he can remember the first game of Senet he played after reconstructing the rules. A good-natured groan. “The guy that I manufactured this with, we played it and played it,” he said. “And then after a while we discovered some glitches in the original rules and then we made variations to compensate.” He laughs. “I guess that’s the way most design happens. I guess it’s like designing a computer or something. You have to get all the bugs out of it. It’s the same with games.”</p> <p>10 Tutankhamun’s Senet board is quite the pip. I pause here because I know that, after I close down Skype, I’m going to load up that Steam version of Senet again - a version that is based on an amended set of Dr Kendall’s own rules - and I’m going to have a second, proper go on it. And to do that I need to know a bit more. I need to know what Dr Kendall honestly makes of Senet as he has it. Senet that is “hypothetical, but based on best evidence”.</p> <p>“Well, you know, it seems like the fun, it can’t just be pure luck,” he ventures. “You have to have a little bit of strategy. It seems as if there was a little bit of skill involved, that would help to make it more fun. But it’s hard to figure out how you can put the skill in when everything is just based on the numbers that come up on the throwsticks.” He frowns. “In that case maybe the fun might be the gambling. Whether you win or lose something. I don’t know. I don’t have any good ideas about that. I haven’t put my mind to this in a very long time, but it seems like all of these games are pretty much throw-the-dice-and-move-the-pieces. Unless there was an intellectual component, where you have to recite certain texts or something.”</p> <p>He nods. “They probably gambled on it. Gambling’s probably, you know, what made it a little more exciting.”</p> <p>Dr Kendall left me with the sense that I wasn’t playing Senet correctly. Our chat reminded me, in a roundabout way, of my first night in Cairo back in the late ’90s, on which I stood nervously at the curb of a busy downtown junction for about 10 minutes waiting for a break in the clamouring procession of lorries and cabs. I was tiny and alone beneath a full-building advert depicting an avocado bathroom sink, four storeys tall and drawn in a disconcertingly heroic high style. I would probably still be on that curb right now if it hadn’t been for a long-limbed, rather beautiful Egyptian man in gigantic specs and a flapping Hawaiian shirt who lead me out into the traffic with a dangerous confidence, saying, “Boy, come on. You have to learn to walk like an Egyptian.” He really said that. (I never did learn.)</p> <p>For Senet, weird and naff as this sounds, maybe I had to walk like an Egyptian. My theory up to this point was that, hey, people are people wherever - and whenever - you go. Maybe Senet was actually arguing otherwise. I loaded up Steam and tried to understand this strange back-and-forth game. I tried to look at it differently. Boy, come on.</p> <p>And, well: partial victory. Senet’s not a dull game, but it is fiddly. As it’s about getting your draughtsmen off the board, there’s a sense of bureaucratic pushing and shoving to it - a bit of a packed elevator experience. With all the squares that require specific throws, and all the squares that are blocked and defended, the RNG is rather strong. And, since in many cases you don’t really have a choice of which piece to move, as the end-game approaches, it gets progressively less tactical. After an hour or two I had yet to play a game in which the likely outcome didn’t veer back and forth madly in the final two minutes. This could be exciting, but since most of the action is actually relegated to the last 5 of the 30 squares - no! houses! - there’s a fair amount of waiting to get to that point. Senet feels, more than anything, like a game that is won or lost by stragglers. It’s certainly not a game with a massive scope for heroism. Leave the heroism to the gods and the giant bathroom sinks. You can see why people may have felt inclined to bet on this.</p> <p>And yet I felt something else, too. Talking to Dr Kendall had reminded me that I was engaged in an activity very similar to something that Nesperennub may have known. If I had met him, through some as yet undiscovered technology, we might be able to commune over this. I could almost imagine reading his body language and facial cues: the smile of delight when he knocked one of my pieces into the water, the comradely shrug when I rolled my fourth consecutive three and had to retire, again, without a useful move. Nesperennub, long, aristocratic head leaned low over the board. Nesperennub, squeezing his lips together as he ponders his options. Senet, eh? The passing game. The great leveller.</p> <p>One bottle of lemonade</p> <p>Maybe - and this seems almost blasphemous - games really have changed. Maybe people have changed, and today we want different things from games than the ancient Egyptians wanted from Senet. Maybe they found the shuffling rhythms of the game of passing to be thrilling, or at least true: the smallness of human life captured against the unchanging vastness of the landscape of the gods. Is that it? Senet is a game in which the player can often feel irrelevant, halting and endlessly undecided when contrasted so sharply with the beautiful order of the three lanes, the 30 houses. And the only objective? The only hope? To get off the board. Not quite an escape. No. More an understanding that we were never meant to be there in the first place.</p> <p>I was guessing, frankly, so to get a better insight into the world to which Senet belonged, I went to the British Museum to visit a friend and colleague of Dr Kendall.</p> <p>The re-making of XCOM Looking back at how Jake Solomon completed his 10-year mission. The re-making of XCOM Dr Irving Finkel is a reader and translator of Cuneiform (the first written language on Earth and also a word that I discover, three minutes into our conversation, that I have been seriously mispronouncing for 20 years), a leading authority on the pre-Biblical flood narrative, and also an expert on board games - ancient and, I suspect, otherwise.</p> <p>And he is strangely perfect, vast hair and vast beard, tweed and corduroy, padding across the great bright hall of the British Museum to meet me. He has that slight impatience of a person who lives inside his head a lot and is always having interesting conversations in there, and he has the absolute best route to the office of anyone I have ever met. Off to the left, past the Rosetta Stone, sharp turn after Ramses II or whoever it is, and briskly upstairs, towards the inevitable unmarked door that you would never normally notice. And then, battered key already disappearing back into pocket, through to - what’s this?</p> <p>I’m tempted to call it the real British Museum. The working building. Backstage, where the floor is suddenly scuffed concrete rather than marble and glossy parquet, where great things are stacked all around, where parchments are rolled and stuffed - carefully - in little wooden cubby holes, and where Dr Finkel himself has a narrow workspace, crippled bookcases overflowing on either side of a large window offering an unspoiled view of an entirely featureless wall. There’s an old computer on the desk and the entire room is held in the gentle gaze of a man in a faded sepia photograph that’s been propped upon nearby clutter. Theophilus Goldridge Pinches (M.R.A.S.), a pioneering Assyriologist, the man who offered the correct reading of the word “Gilgamesh” when the rest of the world thought it was “Izdubar”, and “the finest scholar the museum ever had,” according to Dr Finkel. Dr Finkel should probably know. His job title is the Assistant Keeper of Ancient Mesopotamian Script, Languages and Cultures in the museum’s Department of the Middle East. In a multiple choice scenario you would not struggle to match his headshot with his occupation. Unless one of the other options was “wizard”.</p> <p>Dr Finkel is not an establishment type. He is scandalously entertaining to listen to, whether he’s referring to the ancient Egyptians’ “fatuous way of painting everybody looking like cardboard,” or unleashing one of his elegant multi-part sentences that seem to prop up the traditional viewpoint of a subject before undermining it, fatally, with a jolting sub-clause that goes off like a landmine. He met W. C. Bell, he of the suggested rules for “Senat”, as a young boy, when he got Bell’s book out of the library and then sent him a letter to tell him how much he enjoyed it. Bell invited him up to Newcastle - “it was the days before we were all worried about child molesting,” - and talked to the young Irving Finkel about his collection of board games.</p> <p>“It was a wonderful thing!” beams Dr Finkel. “It completely affected my entire life. Because he had a whole houseful of stuff and he was the sort of bloke who didn’t have a lot of money, so he found things in junk shops and didn’t know what they were. And he made replicas of things that he couldn’t find. He worked things out. Academically it’s got holes in it, but it really got me involved.” He pauses. “He was very kind to me.”</p> <p>I try out my theory on Dr Finkel: that games offer what is potentially one of the more human perspectives on the ancient past. That they provide a way of looking at ancient people in a way that makes them more recognisable.</p> <p>“I think that’s right,” he says. “And I think Senet’s probably the weakest illustration of that argument.”</p> <p>Dr Finkel, it transpires, is not a fan of Senet. “The first crucial point to make,” he tells me, leaning back in the creakiest chair I have ever encountered, “is that board games exist long before ancient Egyptian culture was up and running. This goes right back into the Neolithic.”</p> <p>The Neolithic, or New Stone Age! A period that’s generally seen as lasting between 10,200 BC and somewhere around 2000 BC. That takes you from the invention of farming to the widespread use of metal tools: a busy time. In the Middle East, in places like Jordan, Syria, Israel, the Lebanon, there are Neolithic gaming boards that take the form of a parallel row of holes, usually five. These are crude boards made of limestone, and you find them all over the place. “So this comes from a horizon when homo sapiens is living in some kind of urban complex,” Dr Finkel explains. “Usually walled, lot of people living together, shared responsibility, somebody in charge, all those sorts of things, even though it’s before pottery. It’s the beginning of the domestication of plants and animals, but it’s before pottery. We have in this horizon a good distribution of these objects which unquestioningly are gaming boards as opposed to counting devices or calendrical things.”</p> <p>Scattered over the Neolithic world, all of these boards are, essentially, different versions of the same game. They’re spontaneous eruptions of a single brilliant idea: player one against player two in a race. And this, to Dr Finkel, is the first hint of why games might be important.</p> <p>Meet the creator of Jenga Do you really know the rules? Meet the creator of Jenga “It’s very interesting to wonder whether they might not be more deep-seated in human development,” he says, tentatively and then hitting his stride. “Because my own view is that games probably had something to do with the whole scenario of the evolution of speech and grammar and ‘I’m me and you’re you and I can run faster than you.’ That sort of idea. That games might come into existence as a symbolic and harmless form of violent opposition.</p> <p>“I think it’s to do with the very time when, however it worked, speech and grammar became part of it all. I have a theory that opposition is the crucial thing: ‘I’m me and you’re you’ is like the first grammatical distinction. Once you’ve got that agreed, once somebody realises that one noise means me and another means you, everything else follows. You have to have plurals, you have to have names, you have to have verbs and I think it must have been a very volcanic matter that counting, which is an abstraction, and speech, which is an abstraction, and possibly music, singing and sounds, all of those things probably came in one fizzy bottle of lemonade and I think that probably this stuff, the board games, came out of it too.” Deep breath. “It was probably a huge jump. It wasn’t: ‘Oh, I’ve got an idea, why don’t we have one square and…’ I think it must have been more that once something happens with the human brain it goes in a very, very fizzy way.”</p> <p>And does Senet, which turns up after the Neolithic, have that same sense of fizziness? Dr Finkel suddenly sags back in his chair. He glances at Pinches. The very thought of Senet seems draining. “I think I’ve tried all these things,” he says, “and Senet as represented in this shuffling thing is a laborious and unexciting matter.” Dr Finkel thinks for a few seconds. “The most lucid writing about how Senet might have worked is certainly Kendall. He’s a very gifted scholar and he writes with a great deal of common sense. His booklet about it is probably the best thing that’s been done about it. And he records what we know and what we can say. And yet.”</p> <p>This and yet is the start of another mystery about Senet - perhaps the greatest mystery of all. Namely: The ancient Egyptians played this game throughout the entire lifespan of their empire, but nobody else did. Senet didn’t travel. And that doesn’t make any sense at all.</p> <p>Because games travel. Dr Finkel’s written about this at length, most succinctly in the introduction to the book Board Games in Perspective, which he edited several years back. “In fact games spread from culture to culture in a way that has hardly any parallel,” he writes. “They exist on a level impervious to religion or politics, and represent a free means of communication between people that nothing can successfully interrupt.”</p> <p>You can hear it when you read that. You can hear the march of games! Games crossing battlefields, scaling the wires. Football on Christmas day in the trenches. (3-2 to the Saxons, allegedly.) Tetris busting out of Communist Russia. Leaders unable to do anything except give in and play along like everybody else.</p> <p>But Senet? “The interesting thing about Senet,” Dr Finkel tells me, “is that it’s unlike all the other games of the Middle East in my mind because it’s a very well represented or strong presence in Egypt, probably fluctuating in periods, but it’s not played outside in the rest of the Middle Eastern world as far as we know. There are some very crude boards from Cyprus, which look like the kind of things workmen did when they’re having their sandwiches, some of which have three by ten squares, some of which don’t. Everybody says, ‘This is Senet on the island of Cyprus.’ I don’t believe it myself. I think the general rule is that the games of the Middle East that we know about, which is the Game of Twenty Squares, The Game of Fifty-Eight Holes, were played everywhere. In Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, sometimes as far afield as India and Pakistan.</p> <p>“And these games, such as we have, have some very important characteristics which explain why this is the case,” he continues. “The first point is that there’s an evolutionary process loose in the world that means when a game comes into existence or is first thought of, if it’s no good it dies very quickly. When people have a game when they try inventing new ideas about it, they also die very quickly. And actually what you have, in the games that we do have, is they’re all race games, except Senet, which is probably not quite a race game, so you have this distillation out of all the potential games that you might have into quite a small tightly knit group, and they go everywhere, and they spread without writing and certainly without military conquest all over the Middle Eastern world in increasingly wide circles. So they have a life that is under the radar in the sense of politics or anything like that. They just go from merchant to merchant. Mercenary to mercenary. And so they spread.”</p> <p>x Graffito versions of ancient board games are fairly common. This is the Royal Game of Ur, scratched onto an artefact from the palace of Sargon II. They really did. Senet’s biggest contemporary rival is the Game of Twenty Squares, also known as the Royal Game of Ur, since a handful of boards were unearthed in the 1920s by Sir Leonard Woolley in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, a Sumerian city-state located in what is now southern Iraq. Dr Finkel’s a useful person to talk to about this, because, as Bell and Kendall sought to uncover the rules to Senet, he worked out how the Royal Game of Ur was probably played.</p> <p>Lionhead: the inside story The rise and fall of a British institution, as told by those who made it. Lionhead: the inside story “What actually happened was, when I got here to the British Museum, I found this tablet that nobody had read properly,” Dr Finkel tells me. The tablet was written, in Cuneiform, by a Babylonian astronomer. “I realised it was the rules for a game,” laughs Dr Finkel. “And then realised it was The Game of Ur. It took a lot of work to solve all that. That brought my interest in games, which was just private thing, into a different perspective.”</p> <p>The Royal Game of Ur knew how to travel. It entered Egypt by the middle of the Bronze Age, which started around 3150 BC, but it has also worked its way through Pakistan, Persia, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Cyprus and Crete. A form of the game survives to this day in India, where it is called Asha. It’s staggeringly successful at staying alive and on the move. And there’s an obvious reason. “That tablet I translated,” says Dr Finkel, “the point about it is the game that you can squeeze out of it has an elemental good quality about it. A comes from one side, B comes from the other, and they race up the middle and off the end. It’s infinitely more dynamic than Senet. I always look at this from the point of view of what would happen if you played them at home. One of the points of playing a really good board game is to annoy your brother or sister by beating them. With the Royal Game of Ur, right up until the last minute there is this question of who’s going to win. Whereas with Senet, you shift back and forth at the end a bit, but nobody would give a damn after half an hour anyway.”</p> <p>The Royal Game of Ur really is brilliant, and it’s the board that makes it so. Like Senet, the task of each player is to get their pieces to safety, but with Ur, both sides have their own starting points, and then they have to meet in the middle row, where the territory thins out and they’re suddenly stumbling over each other. There are safe spots, marked by rosettes on the spaces, but otherwise it’s a bloodbath, the Sumerian equivalent of Baby Park in Mario Kart Double Dash. Land on an enemy piece and you send them back to the start.</p> <p>Ur’s so full of temptation, because each safe spot also grants you another turn. It’s so tactical, too, because you’re constantly choosing between getting one of your draughtsmen to safety or bringing another one into play. It feels fair, unlike Senet, because both sides start in identical circumstances, and as play moves to that alleyway in the centre, the whole thing becomes a game of wit, speed, skill and cruelty. Confrontation is unavoidable. The game’s over in minutes. Would play again.</p> <p>SORRY TO BOTHER The appeal of Nintendo’s new handheld play is plain to see The timing was strange, to say the least. Nintendo had asserted that its line of dedicated handhelds wasn’t necessarily over now that its new hybrid was on… How to save Mass Effect Andromeda The details of Mass Effect 3’s ending controversy need not be recounted, as it remains one of gaming’s most pervasive disappointments. The damage it did to… Speaking of temptation, it’s tempting to see Ur as a game in which the player is in control of their own destiny, and Senet as one in which they are buffeted by a mercurial fate. It’s also tempting, although almost certainly incorrect and probably unintentionally offensive, to wonder if a little contamination hasn’t taken place. No, a little transference. Senet, as Dr Kendall has it, is a magnificently reasonable game, in that both sides are equally troubled by circumstance. It has Dr Kendall’s obvious gentleness, his even-handedness, in its measured procession to the final goal. The Royal Game of Ur, however, is knockabout and aggressive. It’s a game in which you throw your whole energy into causing mischief for your opponent, a game in which, once you have made your moves, you lean back in your creaking chair and call things as you see them.</p> <p>The journey of the soul</p> <p>Here, then, is the problem as I see it. For Senet to have been played for so long in ancient Egypt, it must have had something great about it. And yet! If it did have something great about it, shouldn’t it have been played outside of Egypt too? How do you have one circumstance without the other?</p> <p>The short version? Dr Finkel states the case with weary precision. “I think the fact is that this is an Egyptian game par excellence and one of the reasons that nobody else wanted to play it was that it wasn’t very interesting.”</p> <p>The long version? The long version is much, much longer.</p> <p>Perhaps, for starters, part of the reason Senet didn’t travel was because of the way the Egyptians ran their empire. Could it be that the ancient Egyptians were isolationists rather than imperialists? “That’s a good question,” says Dr Kendall. “They didn’t have very much success converting anybody to their way of thinking in the Levant. They conquered all those people, Canaan and all those cities. They ruled them. But with a few exceptions, like Sudan, which they saw as part of Egypt, they didn’t convert them. They considered them Asiatics and people with their own gods and cultures. They didn’t try to change them.”</p> <p>This was pragmatism, according to Dr Kendall, but it does also suggest that Egypt might not have been too concerned with exporting culture such as favoured games. On top of that, there’s the possibility that we still haven’t entirely cracked Senet yet - that there is simply more to it in the first place. “There’s more than one view of it all, and I have a feeling that there’s probably more to be said about Senet really than has been said,” muses Dr Finkel. I mention to him that even Dr Kendall wasn’t sure he had totally nailed it. “Oh, he didn’t,” says Dr Finkel. “He had ideas. It’s very clear what he wrote and it’s very sensible, but it’s not nailed.”</p> <p>Murkier still, it’s possible that the ancient Egyptians had an entirely different understanding of even the most basic elements of Senet. John Tait is the emeritus professor of Egyptology at UCL, and he’s spent a lot of time trying to work out whether the ancient Egyptians gambled on the games they played. One of the most striking ideas suggested by his research is that the very notion of odds may not carry across particularly cleanly between the ancient world and the world we live in today. Modern games often use dice rolls as randomisers, allowing for an element of chance within the design, but there’s no indication that the Egyptians who played Senet explored the concept of probability as a measure of likelihood - and yet they had throwsticks that seem to perform a similar job to dice.</p> <p>It’s possible, then, bearing Professor Tait’s work in mind, that Senet’s reliance on the randomising factor of the throwsticks may not have seemed much like a reliance on a randomising factor to the game’s original players. Maybe Senet was a game in which the gods played alongside you, and the casting of the throwsticks became a form of divination: the gods exerting their will on the board. Would that have made it more engaging?</p> <p>(It’s worth mentioning here that when I emailed Professor Tait to discuss his work on this matter, he was eager to point out that it’s very dangerous to think of the ancient Egyptians as being different in some crucial way. Modern people often display a highly personalised take on probability too. “The dice are really with me today.”)</p> <p>Divination can be surprisingly tricky to separate from ancient board games in general. Take the Royal Game of Ur, which is itself tangled up with everything from astrology and the zodiac to the notion of fortune-telling using sheep livers - which some people suspect provided the origin of the unusually shaped Ur game board. And even setting probability aside, there is no question that Senet became increasingly religious the more that the ancient Egyptians played it. According to Dr Peter Piccione, the associate professor of Ancient Near Eastern History at the University of Charleston, South Carolina, Senet boards of the Old and Middle Kingdoms tended to be decorated in secular ways - with numbers and directions and little else. By the New Kingdom - the period between the 16th and 11th centuries BC - however, religious imagery is the norm, and there is a clear sense that a game that was already venerable has taken on an entirely new dimension.</p> <p>Dr Piccione paints a picture of religion coming to Senet in waves, and over a long period of time. “At least 4000 years ago, the Senet game came to be associated with notions about the migration of the ba and the Egyptian funerary cycle of life, death and spiritual renewal,” he writes in a paper titled, ‘The Egyptian game of Senet and the migration of the soul.’ Perhaps it was not a huge leap. Boards, as Dr Piccione notes, had always been placed in tombs since the Old Kingdom, even if the trash-talking in the associated wall art suggests that the game started off as a secular affair. By the 6th Dynasty, however, Senet was being depicted as a means by which living players could commune with the dead directly. “The fact that the game became a conduit of such communication indicates that it had acquired its own inherent religious meaning,” Piccione writes. And telephoning the afterlife was just the beginning.</p> <p>By the start of the 12th dynasty, Senet was connected to the deceased’s ability to travel freely on earth, tying the game to the passage of the spirit throughout the day. By the end of this dynasty, it was also bound up with the ba’s return to the tomb after its nightly journey through the netherworld.</p> <p>Over time, in fact, the netherworld became increasingly important to Senet. The Senet Ritual outlined in Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead enables the ba of the player to achieve the “mobility”, as Dr Piccione has it, that is required to travel between the lands of the living and the deceased. Once the game became linked with the journey the sun god took through the netherworld every night, the Senet board effectively became a map of that hazardous territory. Senet’s transformation from game to spiritual tool was seemingly complete.</p> <p>According to Dr Finkel, these religious elements did little to help Senet as a piece of game design. “That turgid business about the underworld and each square having a special meaning, and weighing the soul and swallowing the demons,” he says, “the most important thing it shows about Senet is that it’s a game of steady progression, where luck is not really so crucial. Because if they utilised the game of Senet in this underworld in a way where what happened to you was contingent upon it, you wouldn’t want the chancey thing to be quite so dominating. So it may give you some sense that the game itself was rather sedate.”</p> <p>A few sources. Alongside talking to a lot of interesting people, I read a number of fascinating things while trying to learn about Senet. I’m sure I’ve forgotten some of them, but here are at least a few of my sources.</p> <p>First off, this is Senet as I encountered it. It’s pretty basic, but it uses a modified version of Dr Kendall’s rules. This, meanwhile, is The Royal Game of Ur, and while it might not look like much, it is great fun. There is a very beautiful Ur board in the British Museum that is worth looking at, if you are willing to climb a lot of stairs.</p> <p>If you want to know more about Nesperennub, there’s a wonderful piece in the New Scientist from 2004. It’s called Nesperennub Unwound, and it’s by Stephanie Pain. You’ll need a log-in to read it. If you’re interested in mummification in general - and who isn’t? - The Mummy Congress by Heather Pringle is an amazing book, and also managed to chill me out about dying, as long as I am left out in the open for the crows to pull apart.</p> <p>The “marrow of the skull” line is from Minds Behind the Brain, a brilliant history of neurology by Dr Stanley Finger, in which I also discovered that Aristotle was way off about what goes on inside human skulls. Lots of stuff on Egyptian triage in there, too, none of it enormously pleasant. Short version: plenty of grievous injuries in ancient Egypt once the Pharaohs turned the place into a giant building site.</p> <p>Pepi-Ankh’s ancient trash-talkers are from In search of the meaning of Senet by Dr Peter Piccione. It is full of interesting things, and I’m sure I used more from it than just these guys.</p> <p>I first read about Hesyre - or Hesy-Re - the Egyptian dentist in Who’s Who in Ancient Egypt by Michael Rice, but I think Dr Piccione has written about him too. I also discussed him with Dr Kendall. His tomb is at Saqqara if you ever find yourself in the neighborhood.</p> <p>Dr Irving Finkel is an extraordinary man, and I can’t recommend his book The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood strongly enough. There’s a lot about the flood in there, obviously, but he does talk about The Royal Game of Ur near the start and there are some thrilling discoveries of graffito gaming boards too, several scratched into the plinths of statues and left unnoticed for millennia. Be warned: he will make you want to jack everything in and become an Assyriologist - if you don’t want to be one already.</p> <p>Another of Dr Finkel’s books was extremely useful on numerous fronts. Board Games in Perspectives contains a brilliant introduction from Dr Finkel himself, where he talks very lyrically about the power of games, and a number of excellent essays from the academic community. Andrea Becker’s article on The Royal Game of Ur helped put Senet’s big rival in context for me, W. J. Tait’s piece Were There Gamesters in Pharaonic Egypt is very good on this particular ancient culture’s ideas regarding probability (Dice, a small book by the magician, actor, historian and all-round legend Ricky Jay, is also very handy on this front; it has lovely photographs of decaying celluloid dice taken by Rosamond Purcell who likes to document things that are falling apart), and The Egyptian Game of Senet and the Migration of the Soul by Dr Peter Piccione, once again, is wonderful for tracing the evolution of the religious elements - or the growing contamination by them, as Dr Finkel might have it - in Senet.</p> <p>Finally, Dr Bell’s book Board and Table Games from many Civilisations is an absolute treat and you will not regret buying it, particularly if you have kids and a summer holiday looming. Inevitably, I have left a lot of other sources out - and I wish I could remember where I read about the bamboo chessmen who could be eaten once they were captured - but these few hopefully cover the basics. Any mistakes in the article are mine. Apologies! Finkel’s also unconvinced that being tied up with religion actually did much to keep the game afloat. “I think you can’t go wrong if you take timepass as the sort of overriding box in which board games should always be fitted,” he argues. “And that other things are local, or temporary, or flare up and flare down, but timepass is the plodding thing that makes it all work. I think that’s actually nice to think about. And so Senet is everything to do with funerary stuff, but people also played Senet in pubs, not thinking about their souls for sure, maybe with completely different rules. In my view, the general rule would be that board games are essentially for enjoyment and essentially to fill in time when there’s nothing better to do. People who talk about these things forget, for example, that in antiquity there was no internet. Television. Telephone. Radio. Or anything to do after dark apart from have sexual intercourse and go to sleep.”</p> <p>y Impasse, by Wanderlands, is a wonderful browser and iOS game that plays with the elements of Senet in clever ways. Could the religious aspect of the game be a reason that other cultures seem to have rejected Senet, however? Back to Dr Kendall, who says: possibly. “Why wasn’t it popular outside of Egypt? Maybe because it was too involved with the Egyptian way of perceiving the cosmic, and the afterlife,” he laughs. “Maybe because it was something that was related to the Egyptian religion whereas the Game of Ur was more overwhelmingly secular and could cross boundaries fairly easily. The fact that you have it in India, Syria, Babylonia, and then it goes to Egypt, maybe it spans all those cultures because it’s purely secular. Whereas Senet, maybe it just got a little too involved in the funerary rituals of the Egyptians and therefore wasn’t of interest to anyone else.”</p> <p>“I think that’s unlikely,” says Dr Finkel when I put this to him. “Because games exist below the radar, as I said. In India, you have people in the court playing Parcheesi with lifesize figures and jeweled dice, but taxi drivers round the back will be playing the same thing on a board made of chalk with bits of dung. The part of Egyptian culture where such religious matters were discussed or experimented with or taken for granted was not a great mass of people. Not farmers and sailors. There is a picture for example of two blokes playing Senet on a river, where they’re sitting. That to me seems to be a board game that’s got nothing to do with the underworld whatsoever. So I think, as I see it, there’s the real life of this game, and then there’s the funerary matter, and by virtue of what survives, we have an overwhelming prejudice - or rather contamination - from that funerary aspect. The secular stuff, that’s its real life in a way, and I think it’s salutary to bear that in mind.”</p> <p>The Back of the Board</p> <p>One thing certainly did change once the game became more religious, however. Its audience grew in diversity. Commoners were soon playing the game as well as nobles and kings; women were playing as well as men. Senet games are suddenly turning up as graffito, scrawled on masonry blocks and pavements. One, according to Dr Kendall, is even found drawn in ink on a schoolboy’s writing table.</p> <p>I’m fascinated by this because it gives a sense of the game in situ, of the world going on around the board itself. “There are pictures of people playing this game in their everyday lives,” beams Dr Kendall. “Then of course pictures appear in tombs. And the afterlife was meant to be like the daily life, so it was a type of amusement. There’s a grotto up above Derel-Bahari where the workmen who were building the temple must have gone for their lunch hour. You can see on the walls there are pornographic pictures of the Pharaoh, which I guess was Hatshepsut. But on the floor, there are Senet boards scratched in the ground.”</p> <p>What Dr Kendall is getting at here - and what Senet is ideally placed to explore - is the surprising absence of boundaries in the Egyptian world between the sacred and the secular. As Dr Piccione is at pains to point out, “the secular Senet game was played for recreational purposes, while the religious version was performed to communicate with the dead, to effect the passage of the ba, and to achieve spiritual renewal. [But] it may well be that all of these reasons could be the purpose for playing the game at any one time…. The Egyptians did not distinguish between religious ritual and recreational activity. It is Western intellectual thought which separates these notions, and demarcates the sacred from the profane.”</p> <p>“I think I look at it like this,” says Dr Kendall at last. “That there was a game called Senet, that was fun enough. It wasn’t any less fun than any of these other games that are all just dice-throwing games, but then the people injected the funerary business into it to make it more exciting. To make it more interesting to them. And I think that was an added element that may not have changed the rules but that enriched it all.”</p> <p>If there’s a human insight lurking inside Senet, then, it might be tangled up with this. And it’s Dr Kendall who finds a way of expressing it that I can understand. “When you see that people put these things in their tombs,” he says, “when you see a range of things coming out of tombs and these are the personal effects of people who lived and that this is what they wanted with them in the next life, you see that this was a major form of entertainment. Even in the Old Kingdom tombs, you see the tomb owner who’s shown at great big scale, playing Senet with people at a small scale.”</p> <p>He pauses. “I think that’s what got me about Senet in the beginning, you know. How long this thing lasted. It’s so typical of Egyptian culture that people’s habits, formed in the fourth millennium BC, were changed so little by time. Lately I’ve been interested in measurement. I discovered that the Egyptian royal cubit, which is 52.3 centimetres, was used throughout the entire period, without any change, from the middle of the fourth millennium at least until Roman times. And that sculptors and architects used this measurement and its divisions to create everything. Everything was measured according to this way, all the way through, from beginning to end.”</p> <p>But didn’t Heraclitus state that the only constant is change? Was Egyptian culture a grand attempt to do something impossible, to fix the world in place and stop it from moving? Is Senet’s longevity hinting at a mummification of culture, in much the same way that the embalming priests would mummify the remains of the anointed dead, like Nesperennub?</p> <p>“The Egyptians had a concept called Maat,” answers Dr Kendall, “which is loosely translated as order or justice, or righteousness. It simply means: this is the way things should be done. You had to do things the way they should be done in order to win favour of the gods. And the kings are always shown giving the little Maat figures - she was a goddess - giving Maat to the gods, and then the gods are giving life to the king. So the whole thing was: we know how things should be done. We know how things should look. We know what’s the proper religion. We know the proper artforms. These are the things that should be perpetuated. So this order was a crucial part of the religion.</p> <p>3 Maat: truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice. “I suppose it’s the way that certain religions insist that you can’t eat pork or you can’t do this, you have to do things this way. The Egyptians took this concept to the way that everything should look. So if you have a religion, of course over time things are changing, but everything is changing within the concept of Maat. That’s why everything kind of looks the same when you go to the British Museum and go through the Egyptian galleries. Everything is the same from beginning to end - up to a point.”</p> <p>Up to a point.</p> <p>But nothing lasts forever, and things can start to change on a fundamental level long before anybody really notices. Even Pharoahs.</p> <p>I was patched out of EVE Online How one update ended a six-year career. I was patched out of EVE Online And so. There are two ancient games: Senet and the Royal Game of Ur. Two races games at heart, played on similar boards and with similar rules. But one game is slow, and one is fast. One is local and embellished, over the centuries, by religious thinking, and one is an interloper, abstract and uncomplicated, arriving from the Middle East with the Hyksos kings and then spreading at an astonishing rate.</p> <p>For a while, these two games coexisted, and by the 17th dynasty, they had grown rather close. We know this because the game boxes have survived to tell us: Egyptian game boxes in which the draughtsmen and throwing sticks were kept safe within a little chamber, while the board served as a lid.</p> <p>But this proximity is perhaps deceptive.</p> <p>SORRY TO BOTHER Hands-on with Tekken 7 - and its PlayStation VR mode It’s been a long time coming.

Because nobody wants to play it anymore. Not even in Egypt.</p> <p>“At least that’s how I see it.”</p> <p>Senet (MdC transliteration zn.t) was a game for two with five to seven pieces per player. It seems to have been a game of skill and chance, perhaps akin to backgammon and was widely played by people of all social classes. It is an ancient game dating to the prehistoric period and shown in numerous paintings. The picture in the left margin for instance shows Queen Nefertari playing Senet. The elaborately carved game table on the right was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamen (18th Dynasty). Most Senet boards were simpler affairs: slabs of limestone with lines carved into them [16] or simple pieces of wood. The Senet board had thirty squares [10] which were traversed boustrophedonically along an S-shaped pathway. The two players placed their pieces alternatingly on the first ten, if the game was played with five pieces each, or fourteen squares of the board. They were advanced according to the results of throws of little sticks, knuckle bones or more rarely of a teetotum. The aim seems to have been to move all one’s pieces to the last square of the board and remove them. The twenty-sixth square was often called nefer (i.e. good, beautiful - seemingly a “lucky” square), but the following one was some kind of an obstacle which had to be leapt over. According to the Yuya papyrus the game, which since the 18th dynasty at least was imbued with religious significance, [19] was even played in the afterlife: Begin of the raising and glorifying, of the coming forth by day and the descent into the afterworld, of the glorification in the West, the existence in the following of Osiris, the satisfaction with the food of Wennefer, the coming forth by day and the assumption of any shape into which the deceased may want to change himself, of the playing Senet, of the sitting in the Hall as living ba by NN (i.e. the deceased) justified, lord of reverence after he has landed (i.e. died).</p> <p>https://discoveringegypt.com/ancient-egyptian-game-senet/ http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Senet.html https://thepurplepeacepapyrus.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/the-ancient-egyptian-game-of-senet/ http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/leisure/brain-games/senet.htm http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-01-why-did-ancient-egypt-spend-3000-years-playing-a-game-nobody-else-liked http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/games.htm</p> <p>https://lkdjiin.github.io/senet/</p> </div> <ul class="tags"> <li><a href="/blog/tags/egipto">Egipto</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/historia">Historia</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/juegos">Juegos</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/primer">Primer</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/ajedrez">Ajedrez</a></li> </ul> <ul class="social-share"> <li> <a class="facebook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Comparte en Facebook" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=300'); return false;" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/ajedrez/2017/03/26/Senet.html">Comparte en Facebook</a> </li> <li> <a class="twitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Tuitealo" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=250'); return false;" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://localhost:4000/ajedrez/2017/03/26/Senet.html&text=Senet&via=">Tuitealo</a> </li> <li> <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Publica en LinkedIn" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=520,height=570'); return false;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://localhost:4000/ajedrez/2017/03/26/Senet.html&title=Senet&summary=Board%20games%20were%20a%20favorite%20pastime%20in%20Egypt%2C%20and%20Senet%20was%20the%20most%20popular%20of%20these.%20It%20was%20played%20by%20two%20people%2C%20either%20on%20elaborate%20carved%20and%20inlayed%20boards%20like%20the%20one%20found%20in%20Tutankhamen%E2%80%99s%20tomb%2C%20or%20simply%20scratched%20into%20the%20earth.%20The%20oldest%20known%20representation%20of%20Senet%20is%20in%20a%20painting%20from%20the%20tomb%20of%20Hesy%2C%20from%202686%20BC.%0A%0A&source=">Publica en LinkedIn</a> </li> <li> <a class="rss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Subscribete al Feed" href="http://darioarzaba.github.io/feed.xml">Subscribete al RSS</a> </li> </ul> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'https-darioarzaba-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/ajedrez/2017/03/26/Senet.html'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000/ajedrez/2017/03/26/Senet.html'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> </article> </div> <div class="footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <p class="copyright">&copy; 2017 Dario Arzaba - <a href="http://thehearthofdev.x10.mx" target="_blank">Website</a></p> </div> </div> <script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script> <script src="/js/particles.js"></script> </body> </html>
