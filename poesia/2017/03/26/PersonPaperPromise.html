Once on a paper torn from his notebook he wrote a poem And he called it “Innocence: A Question” because that was the question about his girl And that’s what it was all about And his professor gave him an A and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed her That was the year that Father Tracy died And he forgot how the end of the Apostle’s Creed went And he caught his sister making out on the back porch And his mother and father never kissed or even talked And the girl around the corner wore too much makeup That made him cough when he kissed her but he kissed her anyway because that was the thing to do And at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed his father snoring soundly That’s why on the back of a brown paper bag he tried another poem And he called it “Absolutely Nothing” Because that’s what it was really all about And he gave himself an A and a slash on each damned wrist And he hung it on the bathroom door because this time he didn’t think he could reach the kitchen. General overview: This tragic poem describes the stages of life and how time washes the innocence and happiness of someone. The use of everyday situations and common words makes it a special poem because at the end it combines those words into a complex and cold view about what life really means. Meaning: The poem describes 4 stages in life: Childhood, Adolescence, Young Adult and Adult. In each stage his happy reality is substituted for the “real and crude” reality. In the first stage the green symbolizes the contact with nature, the start of life. His dog is everything to care about and there are no worries at all leaving just happiness and relief. The people around him acknowledge that happiness and reward it. The last verses talk about his tree closest relationships: He’s family, friends and love. The family receives a newborn and they are really happy about it, his friends aren’t worried about the school or the money so they can hang out and love is just starting to grow inside everybody’s hearths because they are young. Innocence gives an imaginary shield against the dangers of reality. In the second stage the blue symbolizes the tranquility, the equilibrium between reality and his imagination. The thing he cares about now is reality, not everything is love and happiness he knows that, so he becomes more mechanized and organized. The people around doesn’t reward him. He doesn’t feel special anymore. He’s just another person; he tries to do a good job so and they still acknowledge that. His family doesn’t pay attention to him anymore, his just an adolescent, his friends aren’t there for him because they got to worry about themselves and love has its dangers now, you cannot share what you feel without the risk of getting hurt. The shield starts to fade away slowly and painfully. In the third stage the torn paper from his notebook symbolized that there was still a little torn up piece of hope. The thing he cares now is “Innocence: Question” that meant: Could he hold to that little hope, that little innocence that remained? He starts to realize that you are launched in a bloody competition to make more money at the cost of the suffering of others. The people around doesn’t care about him anymore, the thing he had worked for so long aren’t special in any way so people doesn’t acknowledge them, but he keeps doing them, searching for a purpose. His family doesn’t care a bit about him anymore, they got their own problems now, and his friends are there just with him for convenience, for when they need him and love is fake and superficial but people still do it because society has imposed absurd rules over their life. He now acts every aspect of his life totally automatized and he’s left with little to none time to be happy. The shield finally gives up and the problems of the real word are overwhelming. In the final stage our character tries to light the last remnant of that long forgotten hope, but as he finds his hearth empty of all happiness and love he becomes really angry and depressed. He is now the only one who cares about him, nor are his family or his friends there to look after him. In this state he acknowledges that the only thing that he actually deserved in life was “Absolutely nothing” so he gives himself just that: The perk of being worth nothing, of being dead. Without his shield he takes so much suffering from the outside world that he decides to end his life. DR. Earl Reum: “He changed the world, one kid at a time. In countless speeches and workshops over more than 50 years, Earl Reum persuaded millions of teenagers to dream big; some for an hour, many for a lifetime.” He is a motivational speaker and in some of his conferences he used this poem to illustrate the dangers of suicide if not treated in time. http://www.earlreum.com/index.html http://reumors.typepad.com/reumors/the-wisdom-of-earl-reum/</p> </div> <ul class="tags"> <li><a href="/blog/tags/juventud">Juventud</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/antoniomachado">AntonioMachado</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/poesia">Poesia</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/primavera">Primavera</a></li> </ul> <ul class="social-share"> <li> <a class="facebook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Comparte en Facebook" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=300'); return false;" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/PersonPaperPromise.html">Comparte en Facebook</a> </li> <li> <a class="twitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Tuitealo" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=250'); return false;" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/PersonPaperPromise.html&text=La%20Primavera%20Besaba&via=">Tuitealo</a> </li> <li> <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Publica en LinkedIn" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=520,height=570'); return false;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/PersonPaperPromise.html&title=La Primavera Besaba&summary=A%20PERSON%2C%20A%20PAPER%2C%20A%20PROMISE%0A%0A&source=">Publica en LinkedIn</a> </li> <li> <a class="rss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Subscribete al Feed" href="http://darioarzaba.github.io/feed.xml">Subscribete al RSS</a> </li> </ul> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'https-darioarzaba-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/poesia/2017/03/26/PersonPaperPromise.html'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/PersonPaperPromise.html'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> </article> </div> <div class="footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <p class="copyright">&copy; 2017 Dario Arzaba - <a href="http://thehearthofdev.x10.mx" target="_blank">Website</a></p> </div> </div> <script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script> <script src="/js/particles.js"></script> </body> </html>
