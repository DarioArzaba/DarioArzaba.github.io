Dietz (born 1945) is an American science fiction writer, principally of military science fiction novels and video game novelizations. Dietz grew up in the Seattle area and served in the Navy and Marine Corps as a Corpsman. He graduated from theUniversity of Washington, and lived in Africa for half a year. Dietz has been employed as a surgical technician, college instructor, news writer, television producer and Director of Public Relations and Marketing for an international telephone company. He and his wife Marjorie live near the city of Gig Harbor in Washington State. PROLOGUE Sam Marcus is instructed to wake up Master Chief by his tech chief: Shepherd - Master Orna ‘Fulsamee, ship master, instructed by a minor prophet and his assistant (Bako ‘Ikaporamme) to not fire any weaponry at the human vessel because of the possibility of damaging halo, and instead board it with infantry. They also told Orna that the human vessel should had arrived by mere coincidence. CHAPTER 1 The Pillar of Autumn received direct hits by the alien vessels boarding party, guarded by seraphs. The human longswords fighters did their best to repel the alien invasion. When they came out of their hiding spot in the shadow of the Threshold, Halo appeared in front of them. - Sam shook his head and tried to put his tiredness aside. He was in the cryo Observation Theater and Chief Thom Shephard in the cryostorage unit. They began the countdown to revive the Spartan but Sam started to feel a little bit afraid. He knew that Spartans started with project ORION in 2491 and the success lead to the creation of project Spartan II, but most importantly he knew like all aboard the Pillar of Autumn that this could be the last Spartan. - Master Cheaf was dreaming of his origin planet, Eridanus II, and of his mother, and Dr. Halsey and Cortana. Aside from these memories he also dreamed about a lurking shadow, an immediate threat that he felt powerless to dominate, that’s when the dream faded away and he was back on reality and out of the cryotube. - Sam stared as the Spartan completed the test with a robot like efficiency. Keyes ordered the technicians to get Master Chief to the bridge without delay. When he was about to leave the covenant entered the observation room and killed Sam, then Shepard tried to lead the way to the bridge but was suddenly killed by an explosion. Master Chief knew that the boarding party was advancing fast and hurry to meet the captain past the rage and firefights. Finally in the bridge Keyes briefed him and ordered him the task of protecting Cortana against the covenant by taking her out of the ship in one of the scaping pods. Keyes then lend him his personal weapon, a standard 12.7 mm explosive pistol. - A Special Forces officer from the covenant was assigned an important infiltration mission. Isna ‘Nosolee, his function was as an “Ossona”, or eye of the prophet. He had three mayor objectives, Capture the ships AI, Capture senior personnel and record everything. - Flight Officer Captain Carol Rawley better known as “Foehammer” she made a run for his D77- TC Pelican while leaving the covenant behind. - Yayap a chief grunt lead a group of other grunts throw battle when they stumbled upon an injured elite. They planned on leaving him behind but Yayap knew better and order them to carry him back into the drop ship, that elite was their ticket out of the Pillar of Autumn. - The ODST’s commanded by Major Antonio Silva took the drop pads and leave the autumn with his fellow comrades with a phrase in his mind “We go feet first” - Master Chief finnaly achived to arrive at the lifeboat and even managed to help a fellow marine when he fall mere meters from the door, with Chief on the lifeboat the Captain realized the vessel from The Autumn. - Rawley also managed to get inside his Pelican with his copilot Fry and his crew commanded by Chief Cullen, so they got out from the Pillar of Autumn and into an entry trajectory to Halo. - Keyes take his crew into the last lifeboat and left the Autumn behind in its entry course with the ring. Isna ‘Nosolee stealth with his invisibility cloak into the lifeboat, his plan was to wait for a better moment and capture Keyes. Once everybody was inside the lifeboat Keyes killed the presence that had been fallowing them. Everybody was amused by the elite that seemed too materialized from thin air. CHAPTER 2 Major Antonio Silva’s HEV entered first into the Halo Atmosphere equipped with the class C military AI “Wellsley” because of the famous Duke of Wellington. The AI tried to designate their objective as “Gawilghur” but Silva liked “Alpha base” better. One of the ODST’s died during entry “Marie Postly” but Silva’s concern when getting out of their pods was to take control of Alpha base from the covenant. - Master Chief was marveled at the strange beauty of the construct. The lifeboat failed to land properly and crashed alerting the nearby covenant about his presence, all passengers except him died, he gather whatever ammo he could find and went for the nearby hills. Enemy dropships came down to investigate the wreckage and Jhon killed them with the M6D pistol Keyes gave him. He neutralized 1 banshee and in his advance into the interior of the meadow killed a pack of grunts. Once he heard the sound of battle he hurry to help his fellow marines. - Keyes tried to land the lifeboat near the edges of a mountain but was soon followed by a pair of ghosts. Lovell landed the lifeboat in a pit were it was difficult to locate and the survivors started climbing the hill to organize a temporary camp. In their way up keyes saw the Pilalr of Autumn land far away to the “west”. - The ODST’s meanwhile landed perfectly and under Silvas instructions reorganized to take what would later become Alpha Base. Lieutenant Melissa Mckay and her 130 company also landed near Silva’s location and when they meet, they formed a plan to take the butt using the few pelicans that survived as air support. - Yayap was sleeping when the elite that he and his platoon saved called him, the elite named Zuka’ Zamamee transferred Yayap into his platoon in appreciation for his bravery and for saving his life. He also wanted him to accompany into an important meeting were Zuka would present a plan to the council to kill this extraordinary human that almost took his life. - Mckay and his troops including the company Sargeant Tink Carter went to see the pelicans and the last company under Silva waited to complete the full ground strike. While Silva and his troops waited for the surprise attack, covenant ghosts ambushed the ODST’s and they had to fight for their lives, Silva then ordered a square formation and because of this they win the battle but quickly went to help McKay take the butte. CHAPTER 3 Master Chief went were the marines that survived the landing were facing covenant resistance and helped them in a quick battle reorganizing their troops and waiting for evacuation. After a few dropships that Master Chief rescued from the covenant assaults Echo 419, Foe hammer’s Pelican picked up the marines and dropped her Warthog so they could also search the area for survivors. Sargent Johnson orders Private Fitzgerald, M. to accompany Master Chief and serve as a gunner. Cortana then pinpointed in the direction they should fallow to encounter the last lifeboats; Master Chief turned the warthog on and fallowed that way. - Keyes and his party continued scaping from covenant capture but ensign Dowski started losing his mind and was left behind. Wikings and his team advice Keyes to kept moving, the covenant were close. - The elite Ado ‘Mortumee piloted his banshee above a group of covenant that found Dowski, they made him a deal. - The pilot “Cookie” Peterson dropped the last load of ODST´s into the butte and discovered a covenant plasma turret that was soon neutralized. - Mckay and his surviving marines made one last effort to push forward into the forerunner structure and rendezvous with Silva on top. - Master Chief took a shortcut and travel into a tunnel, with Fitzgerald at the LAAG they cleared their way out of covenant troops, the only obstacle they encountered was a light bridge that John had to pull out so that they could reach the other marines scattered throw the land. Fitzgerald was injured in the process but they ended up saving 63 to finally return to the now called Alpha Base. - Keyes and his crew were surrounded, Dowski give the aliens the location of the party and told them who was in command, and then they killed every single one of them in front of Keyes, and captured him. - Master Chief received a hot shower and a full cycle of uninterrupted sleep. Master Chief was just checking his armor when Silva called him. He didn’t like Spartans because he was a hardcore ODST so he gave a harsh speech to John. - The commanding ship of the covenant fleet was damaged by the brief encounter with the Pillar of Autumn and while the engineers worked hard on repairing it, it now served as a temporal HQ for all the ground operations. Zuka ‘Zamamee entered the council to ask for the prophets permission to assemble a Hunter team and kill the augmented human. Soha ‘Rolamme a council elite speaked in behalf of an unknown minor Prophet that denied his request. - Keyes had been brought aboard the Truth and Reconciliation and had been interrogated and tortured for the third time when Zuka entered the interrogation chamber and asked Keyes the location of the Spartan but Keyes refused knowing that he was too valuable so that Zuka couldn’t damage him. CHAPTER 4 Because of the damage the ship Truth and Reconciliation received it had a blind spot on its sensors, and the human resistance planned on taking advantage of that so that they could rescue Captain Keyes. Master Chief with the help of a dozen ODST’s use the element of surprise to their favor, and cleared their way into the Alien’s gravity lift. Sargent Parker helped maintaining the order with the Helljumpers. With Master Chief clearing the pad with a Shade, and a new load of marines from Foahammer they entered truth and Reconciliation. - Mackay and his Sixty-three Helljumpers marched silently throw the rain into the last known location of the Pillar of Autumn to retrieve the supplies they needed in order to survive. - Now on the ship, Master Chief and his fellow marines traversed the maze like corridors, until they arrived into the bay, where they encountered serious resistance and a pair of Hunters, Sergeant Parker was injured in the encounter. Cortana continued to guide the rescue teams throw the corridors of the ship until the CNI (Command Neural Interface) signal from Keyes was strong. Master Chief then ordered the ODST’s to remain in the bay door because they were slowing him down. Once he rescued Keyes they started retreating into the location of the rescue team.</p> <p>- Mackay guided his full three platoons throw the dark of the night in the direction of the Pillar of Autumn, she was nervous about the success of the mission; after all she was the leader. She remembered an advice an instructor once told her: “Take a look around”. “Ask yourself if there’s anyone else who is better qualified to do the job. Not in the entire galaxy, but right there, at that point in time. If the answer is ‘yes’, ask them to accept command and do everything you can to support them. If the answer is ‘no’, which it will be ninety-nine percent of the time, then take your best shot. That’s all any of us can do” - With Keyes almost rescued it was time to get out of the ship. Foehammer was busy dealing with a pair of Banshees so the only exit seemed to be boarding an alien drop ship. - Zuka, Zamamee and Yayap entered the Truth and Reconciliation council for a second time but were just received by Soha’ Rolamee who told the news that their request to kill the augmented human had been accepted. CHAPTER 5 Once near the Pillar of Autumn McKay with the help of his Troopers planed their run for the ship, and once the rain stopped they advanced and destroyed the few enemy outposts that were guarding the human vessel. - Keyes was finally awake from his deep sleep and started a brief discussion with Major Silva about sending Master Chief to locate Halo’s control room. But while Silva was hesitant about Keyes sending Chief in such an important mission and leaving the ODST’s behind he knew that maybe Master Chief was the only chance of succeeding. - Zamamee started analyzing the report and lay a trap in the silent cartographer where Cortana through would lead them to Halo’s control room. - Mackay was pleased with the first platoon being under the command of Lieutenant Oros and the second one under Lister’s because they were able to clear the lower decks of the ship and they were preparing to load the warthogs with supplies and lead them to Alpha base. A rather difficult task because the covenant would be waiting them in the other side of the valley. - The pelicans headed in the direction of the possible location of the silent cartographer. The LZ was the beach of a little island and the silent cartographer was inside the deep forest and constructs. As soon as the pelicans dropped Master Chief and a bunch of Marines they left off wishing everybody luck. Chief and his comrades started cleaning the island and with the help of a warthog they moved faster and covered more terrain. Once in the possible location of the silent cartographer the covenant used a security system to block the doors so they would have to back step until they found what looked like the installations of the security control center, so chief stepped inside. - Zamamee’s plans where to put an ambush in the security control room with a pair of hunters, a group of grunts and Yayap. When Master Chief entered the little dark room the hunters rushed for the kill, pushing Zamamee into the wall. A group of grunts got nervous and a grunt called Linglin shoot aimlessly, killing the Hunter that was behind, as he was falling death to the ground he pushed his brother with him and Master Chief could now easily kill them both. Zamamme knew that the battle was over and used the dark in the room to save him and Yayap hiding, he needed to be alive for his next encounter with the armored Human. CHAPTER 6 Back into the open, outside of the Pillar of Autumn the three columns of vehicles marched towards alpha base. The covenant massive response was located on top of the two hills that the marines would have to pass between and in the end of the passage stood a third one. Mack organized three platoons, one for airstrikes, one for ground targets and a quick reaction force, and hoped for the best. - On top of the third hill stood Ado’ Mortumee and spied on the human formation keeping an eye on Field Master Noga’ Putumee so that he could write the report of his success. - Banshees and Wraiths initiated the attack but the banshees were ripped off by the marines M41 LAAG’s and the wraith’s suffered from the scorpion’s fire, the ghosts were also intercepted by McKay and her reaction force warthogs. - Lance Corporal “snaky” Jones was thrown from his seat in the battle and without a microphone, he picked up his gear and his sniper and ran into the nearest cave. - Lance Corporal Jones took position at the base of the hills and prepared to shoot “At that moment in time, in that particular place Corporal Jones was God”. He decided to kill Mortumee. - With the security system neutralized Master Chief went back into the silent Cartographer. He grabbed a launcher from the fallen Pelican Bravo 22 and continues on a Warthog. When he finally reached the entrance the hunters Igido Nosa Hurra and Ogada Nosa Fasu were guarding it but were no resistance to Master Chief and his rocket launcher. Once finally inside the complex another pair of Hunters waited for him and managed to injure his shoulder before dying once again because of the rocket launcher. Once in the Silent Cartographer Cortana could locate the control room. They started to get out of the complex while Cortana tried to establish contact with Keyes about the success of their mission but had no response. Johnson, Keyes and Private Wallace A. Jenkins were out of communication range in search of an important covenant facility. Because of an interrogation to a captured elite named Qualamee they started searching the facility for cargo of weapons but instead they freed the flood. Keyes and Jenkins were partially prevented from their free will when the parasite attacked their bodies. CHAPTER 7 Zuka’ Zamamee entered the Council once again and found ‘Rolamee’s head on a pedestal, a prophet then told him that if he failed again on his mission he would end up as ‘Rolamee. Master Chief enter via the pelican inside Halo’ sub corridors and approached the location of the control room, when the pelican couldn’t maneuver anymore they dropped him in the nearest platform and continued his way inside a huge chamber with its own snowy climate patterns, he helped with Fire team Zuly (A lost patrol from Alpha Base), who in return helped Master Chief arrive at the Control room. - On Alpha Base they captured an unknown grunt and maintained him alive by orders of McKay, it was Yayap setting another trap for Master Chief. - Once Master Chief arrived at the Control Room and Cortana was plugin into the ring’s system she warned him about Captain Keyes being in danger and send Master Chief to rescue him. CHAPTER 8 Without any more info Master Chief arrived at the last known location of Keyes. - Keyes was slowly forgetting everything by an induced amnesia from the flood. - With little opposition Master Chief fallowed Keyes team inside the construct, when he arrived to Private Jenkins recording of what happened. The flood had ambushed them as they passed throw the last door that Master Chief just crossed. - In Alpha Base Charlie 217 flown by Lieutenant Rick Hale asked permission to land, in reality it was Zuka ‘Zamamee’s infiltration team. After landing the elites and with their camouflage gear they started looking for the special Human signaled by Yayap. But unable to find him he decided to search for Yayap instead to ask he about his location which yayap did, telling him about the human guarding some banshees. Up in the air Field Master ‘Putumee commanded the covenant dropships but was soon killed by his inexperience dealing with scorpions fire. When Zamamee and Yayap arrived at the banshees the grunt became a revel and ordered his superior elite to pilot the banshee so that they could escape the human base. The battle had ended on Alpha Base. - The Spartan fought this new enemy throw the structure and was amazed by its quality to remain alive but with time and the power of his shotgun he was able to escape into the surface. Foehammer pointed a landing zone for Master Chief and the remaining marines that had survived the flood attack. - Keyes fought for his memories but they all faded away as the other mind consumes them but there was a memory he couldn’t consume: earth’s location was protected by his commander neuro implant. So by remembering his name he would be able to resist the flood total mind control. CHAPTER 9 Master Chief found the extraction point but 343 Guilt Spark took him to the library and explained that in order to contain the flood they needed to activate Halo’s defense system and in order to do that they needed the index. - Silva with Keyes having disappeared again, took command and ordered McKay to set a trap for the covenant, they would start their first offensive move but in the middle of the human attack on a covenant drop ship the flood attacked both sides, killing half of his platoon. Jenkins now as a combat forma was captured, contrary to his only wish of getting killed and finally ending his suffering. - After recovering the index Master Chief and Guilty Spark returned to the control center where Cortana was the last time. She explained to Master Chief that the purpose of Halo was to eliminate all sentient life at the point in which Guilty Spark became hostile seeing that Master Chief wouldn’t be of any use anymore. CHAPTER 10 Master Chief learned how to deal with Spark’s sentinels and got out of Halo’s control room. Once outside Cortana warned him of the possibility of Guilty spark activating Halo without the Index so she explained that they would need to destroy the weapon pulse generators to buy some time. Then they would reach the Pillar of Autumn and create a chain reaction on the fusion reactors so the explosion could destroy Halo. Cortana neutralize the first generator using Master Chief’s active shield. - Mckay explained to Major Silva about the new flood threat and its three principal forms, the infection form, the combat form and the carrier form. - Zuka Zamamee was out of options and fallowed Yayap’s advice of getting inside of the Pillar of Autumn and using a false identity to get some water and food. - Jenkins was held up inside a heavily guarded cell and had attempted suicide twice but Mckay knew that he was different and tried to make contact with him, the only thing that Jenkins could do was point down and nod. Silva interpreted it as the flood planning on attack bellow the butte, so they organized an expedition to the basement and left Jenkins to his suffering. - Master Chief passed throw the raging fight between covenant and flood and continue to neutralize the second and third generator using a banshee to travel faster. When he finished the job Cortana warned him that they would use his suits portable fusion reactor to teleport him throw Halo into the last known location of Keyes, because they needed his CNI to activate the Pillar of Autumn reactors. CHAPTER 11 Master Chief arrived close to Keyes that was held by the flood in Truth and Reconciliation, by the teleportation system Cortana had used. Once inside they hear Keyes but he was losing his mind so they started searching for him. - Keyes almost lost his name this time. The alien force trying to consume his had almost won. It wouldn’t be too long now. - They started advancing slowly until they got near a hole but they were too many enemies and Master Chief fell in the hole and into a pool of coolant under the Ship. But the battle was worse on the ground, the flood was all over the place he barely survived but had no time to rest because he needed to get back into the ship by the central gravity lift. - McKay jumped down into the lower platform of the butt and meet Sargent Lister with the Entry Team. They shoed McKay a hole in the section below them and a pile of Covenant weapons, the flood was gaining intelligence and they were trying to cut throw the metal using the plasma weapons, in one or two days they could had entered and invade the butt. - Once inside the Pillar of Autumn ‘Zamamee and Yayap got the flood and rest they needed. The elite named ‘Ontome placed them into work quickly because they were low on personnel since the recent flood attack. ‘Zamamee now “Huki ‘Unamee” was afraid of being discovered so he relegated his responsibilities to Yayap. Yayap ordered the Jackals to open and checked each module for flood that could be hiding, the Jackals unpleased by this order coming from a grunt felt the opposite when Yayap proved right and the flood tried to ambush hiding inside the crates. He gained the respect of the Jackals. Mckay Company cut throw the last opening the flood had been trying to open to place some charges and close the door. Silva then entered the scene and told the Helljumpers that once the door was sealed they could all try to conquer Truth and Reconciliation and get out of Halo. The flood attacked but a concentration of plasma grenades and full automatic fire gave them the time they needed to seal the shaft. For a day or two at least. - Master Chief reentry the covenant ship and quickly ran to save Keyes but it was too late Keyes screamed: NOO! And so he died. Master Chief searched for his neural implant on the captain’s skull and once they got the code he returned to the shuttle bay and steal a banshee, a lot of fire tried to put down the banshee but Master Chief managed to avoid it and got out alive. He was extremely tired of all the combat he had been throw. CHAPTER 12 Master Chief arrived at the Pillar of Autumn and attempted to land on a lifeboat pod when the banshee engine stopped, giving enough time for master chief to enter but the human vessel but the banshee crashed into the autumn’s hull. They needed to get into the bridge fast but the in a mix of covenant, flood and sentinels they were slowly advancing. The monitor was also on the ship. When they arrived at the bridge and Cortana started the countdown the monitor showed his presence by disabling the countdown and trying to neutralize the ship’s fusion reactor. Cortana was out of option she couldn’t do anything from the bridge so she and Master Chief went to Engineering and try to destabilize the reactor manually by the explosion of a grenade. - Major Silva prepared the assault on Truth and Reconciliation but was warned by Wellsley that if the flood managed to escape in the vessel upon arrival to Earth the planet would fall. - On board of the Pillar of Autumn an improvised reunion by the covenant forces on the Ships situation was depressing. The flood were advancing in every direction, and an army of robots were killing everything on their way and had taking total control on the engineering room. And to make things worse a human had landed on the ship and has been killing everything on their way. So the master field elite asked if someone wanted the mission to search and kill the human. Zamamee offered quickly, he would have his revenge. - Master Chief Travel throws the firefights and carnages arriving at the cryo chamber from there he continued for the Maintenance Control Room. Finally after all the mindless killing they arrived at the engineering room. - McKay and his troops entered the ship via the shuttle bay and initiated the attack from the inside with the objective of taking control of the control room. Meanwhile Silva and his heavily armored Helljumpers entered by the gravity lift with the objective of controlling Engineering. - Yayap was assigned at the communication center to guide the kill team of Zamamee into the location of the Human. - Master Chief entered the Engineering room and headed into level three from where he could take away the safes from the fusion reactor and detonate the grenade inside. - The attack of the humans on the alien Ship was extremely well coordinated and ended up with eighty percent of the ship under human control in a mere of minutes but the risk of the flood was too great and even with the suggestion of Wellsley and Mckay, Silva was still willing to take the ship to earth. Jenkins signaled Mckay of the fiber optic that connected engineering to the control room. Mckay then knew that if she let the ship arrive to earth she would put in danger everybody on Earth so she did what was best for everybody and launched a grenade into the compartment. The ship lose control and crashed into Halo’s surface. - Yayap told Zamamee the exit route that the human would take and Zamamee prepared the trap in the lift. Yayap knew that this was it, everybody was going to die so he steal a bunch of food and methane, put it into a ghost and scape, searching for a place where he could die in peace. For the first time he was happy. - Master Chief manually initiated the explosion of the fusion reactor and searched for an exit, arriving at a lift full of covenant. He would have died if not for Cortana that had still control over some of the ships systems including elevators. She made the elevator fall a few meters so that they couldn’t reach Master Chief and then he put a few grenades inside. This killed everybody on board of the elevator. Master Chief then exited into the surface of the ship and Cortana asked Echo 419 for an extraction. They ran for a Warthog and went to the Extraction point. But Foahammer was destroyed by a banshee patrol without options and little time to waste they went for a Longsword in the bay. - Yayap watched peacefully as the explosion of the Pillar of Autumn began and waited for the imminent end. - Master Chief barely arrived at the vessel and accelerated outside of Halo’s atmosphere. The explosion tore apart Halo. Cortana made a quick scan over the radio frequencies but everything left was silence. Cortana told Master Chief that: “We did what we had to do—for Earth. An entire Covenant armada obliterated. And the Flood —we had no choice. Halo, it’s finished.” “No,” the Chief replied, settling in behind the Longsword’s controls. “The Covenant are still out there, and Earth is at risk. We’re just getting started.”</p> </div> <ul class="tags"> <li><a href="/blog/tags/juventud">Juventud</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/antoniomachado">AntonioMachado</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/poesia">Poesia</a></li> <li><a href="/blog/tags/primavera">Primavera</a></li> </ul> <ul class="social-share"> <li> <a class="facebook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Comparte en Facebook" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=300'); return false;" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/TheFlood.html">Comparte en Facebook</a> </li> <li> <a class="twitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Tuitealo" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=500,height=250'); return false;" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/TheFlood.html&text=La%20Primavera%20Besaba&via=">Tuitealo</a> </li> <li> <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Publica en LinkedIn" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mywin', 'left=200,top=100,width=520,height=570'); return false;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/TheFlood.html&title=La Primavera Besaba&summary=HALO%3A%20THE%20FLOOD%0A%0A&source=">Publica en LinkedIn</a> </li> <li> <a class="rss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Subscribete al Feed" href="http://darioarzaba.github.io/feed.xml">Subscribete al RSS</a> </li> </ul> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'https-darioarzaba-github-io'; var disqus_identifier = '/poesia/2017/03/26/TheFlood.html'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000/poesia/2017/03/26/TheFlood.html'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> </article> </div> <div class="footer"> <div class="wrapper"> <p class="copyright">&copy; 2017 Dario Arzaba - <a href="http://thehearthofdev.x10.mx" target="_blank">Website</a></p> </div> </div> <script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script> <script src="/js/particles.js"></script> </body> </html>
