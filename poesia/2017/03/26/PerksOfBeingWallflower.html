Mary Elizabeth wasn’t Charlie’s Secret Santa; she was of Alice (the other girl with the tattoo). Charlie’s Secret Santa was Patrick after all; he gave him the last piece of his suit, the suit coat. Finally they all started giving each other the last gifts. When it was Charlie’s turn he give Bob a bubble maker, Alice a book by Anne Rice, Mary Elizabeth 40 dollars to print his magazine “Punk Rocky” on color and Sam an old 45 record of “Something” from The Beatles that his Aunt Helen give him before she died. Sam hugged Charlie and whispered “I love you”. Then Sam told Charlie to go to his bedroom so he could have his present, it was an old typewriter with a sheet of paper already attached to it. Sam had written “Write about me sometime” Charlie sit and write in return “I will”. Sam and Charlie smiled. Charlie writed “I love you too” and then Sam looked to Charlie and kissed him. Letter 21: (23/12/91) Charlie’s birthday is tomorrow. He’s going to the mall to buy the Christmas presents. Bill gives a new book for Charlie to read: The catcher in the Rye and he’s also going to be occupied with passing his driver license. He hopes that Sam or Patrick who are in the Great Canon call him. Letter 22: (25/12/91) Charlie goes to shop the day before with his Mother and Sister to buy the Christmas. But he gets too anxious because he doesn’t know watch present to buy for his dad, he gets so pressured that he starts having like an asthma attack. Finally he buys a movie so the family can watch together; the problem is that when they arrived from shopping his father and brother are stuck in the traffic with his brother outside the airport because of snow. His birthday dinner was late and this made Charlie a little bit sad, the fact that his family wasn’t united. So the next morning the presents went really well and the family embark on a trip to Ohio to visit Charlie’s grandmother. The trip started well but things get out of control when his brother started talking about this girl that dating named Kelly. She was a cheerleader majoring in philosophy, Charlie’s sister started criticizing her and his brother defend her to the point where his brother insulted her saying that at least she didn’t allow him to hit her, this made her cry really hard and Charlie’s father stopped the car and looked into Charlie’s brothers in a way that they knew they shouldn’t have fought. From the anger Charlie’s father didn’t wanted to drive so he ordered Charlie to do it until they arrived at his grandmother’s house. When they arrived at his father-side of the family, his grandmother, his great uncle Phil and his Aunt Rebecca they all watched an old movie, play and had dinner, unfortunately he had a lot of cousins so he had dinner in the kids. Charlie then tells his father-side family story. His grandmother had his first husband that died in Korea with whom she had 2 children. Without a husband and struggling to survive she seeks help in his brother, Charlie’s great uncle Phil. He provided a house and she had to worry only in feeding his babies but as time passed and his children became more time consuming she had to look for another husband and in the desperation she married the wrong guy. Grandmother’s new husband not does only hit his children but he hit her also pretty hard, great uncle Phil noticed this and reunited a group of workers to beat up grandmother’s husband. He died after the beating. The unfortunate thing was that Aunt Rebecca adopted his mother pattern and got married with a lot of guys that beat her just like his father did only to get divorced after. This has lead Charlie’s dad to continuously support Rebecca economically. Charlie reflects on this while lying down on the old bed of his father. Letter 23: (26/12/91) After the reunion ended in Ohio, the family returned home. Then Charlie remembers why every Christmas he’s so sad, he describes his Aunt Helen story: So one Christmas on 1983 his aunt Helen lived with his family because she didn’t had any money left even though she went to buy a second gift for Charlie but because of the thick snow she crashed and died instantly, a policeman came to his house to inform the family, Charlie couldn’t believe it at first but when he finally did, he felt really responsible and guilty of Helen’s death. Letter 24: (30/12/91) Charlie finished reading “The catcher in the Rye” a lot of times but that keep him distracted from thinking about his aunt Helen. He passed his license test yesterday without a problem, and when he went to visit her grave he tell her all about his new life and his new friends. Charlie started crying really hard so he also made her the promise of not to cry if it isn’t important things to cry for. With that settled he returned home and distracted himself reading, avoiding crying and having another “panic attack” but no matter how hard he tried he had one, so he thought of going back to the doctor if he couldn’t manage those attacks. Letter 25: (1/1/92) Ok so Charlie is high because of Bob. He writes a lot of nonsense but in all that nonsense he means that he had felt a lot of things lately and he feels grateful for that. He wished that other people feel the same great things he had felt in the past weeks. But the reason Charlie is writing is because he’s hearing Sam and Craig have sex and he above all the other good feeling he’s having right now, overall he wants to suicide himself. CHAPTER 3 Letter 26: (4/1/92) After the party was over and Charlie writed the letter he got out of the house and after he put the letter on the inbox only to fade away and be found by the police man that were walking by. He finally recovered in the hospital and the doctors recommended seeing a psychiatrist just to make sure I didn’t get into this “panic attacks and fade away” but my family didn’t agree and they took me to my house. Charlie arrived home and decided to never use LSD ever again. Letter 27: (14/1/92) Charlie is still struggling to fight the effects of LSD in his body and in his first day of class he missed a class to see Sam and Patrick and seek their help. They gave him a cigarette and that seemed to calm Charlie down, when he could think more clearly he finished his paper about the book “The catcher in the Rye”. Bill was really pleased with Charlie’s work and gave him a more difficult one. The problem is that Charlie now depends on Cigarettes to stay calm. Letter 28: (25/1/92) Charlie feels good after trying to reconstruct his life and reorganize it. He tells how different his new psychiatric is and how much he like him, they talk about a lot of stuff. After that he went to eat with his friends and they have a really good conversation, he enjoyed the conversation and wonder of all the people in the world that were having great conversations and that made him feel really special, part of united group of friends. He felt he was having a good social life, he was really living. Letter 29: (2/2/92) Ok so Charlie is having a confusing day but after all he feels more confident talking to people. He talked to Bill after school and it was a special talk because Bill didn’t just give him another book to read, he actually tell him about his life. Charlie felt he had made another friend. But after school he seemed a little bit too social to what his family was used to so he was a little annoying. This made him confused but he thought of the importance of moderation. Letter 30: (8/2/92) Charlie got a date to a dance with Mary Elizabeth, that’s because he helped with the play she’s arraigning. So he went as usual to see the play she’s arraigning but the problem was that Craig who is supposed to be an important character didn’t arrived do Mary asked Charlie to interpret it’s role, he did it so well that after the party Mary ask him on a date. Charlie was nervous because of the date and he sought her sister for help but she didn’t gave Charlie any so he remained confused about what to do on a first date, never the less he was ready. Letter 31: (9/2/92) Charlie hadn’t felt special in a long time so the date with Mary Elizabeth made him thought that Sam could get a little jealous. But it was totally the opposite she felt really happy for Charlie, she even told him how to act on his first date and give him tips. Even after everything that had happened Charlie secretly wanted to go to the dance with Sam because he still loved her. Letter 32: (15/2/92)<br /> Charlie used the tips he got from Sam and the date went ok, he learned a lot from Mary, his favorite color, book etc. Mary told him she was really grateful for listening all she said and asked him for a future date, Charlie accepted. The problems started when Charlie’s sister ran towards the bathroom crying, and his boyfriend just left the party looking pretty angry. When his sister got out of the bathrooms and went home, Charlie asked her why she was crying and she answered that she was pregnant and her boyfriend left her because of that. Charlie asked her what she would do and she said that because she was over 18, she would abort in a clinic and made Charlie promise not to tell anyone. Letter 33: (23/2/92) Charlie accepted to accompany her to the clinic and after she entered the operations room he felt really nervous about what could happen to her he didn’t tolerate the pressure so he went to the car and started smoking really fast. His sister found him and got angry but Charlie started laughing because that was the last of their worries, she realized that too and they both went home, their parents didn’t notice a thing. At night Charlie went to her room and they finally made up. Letter 34: (7/3/92) Charlie went on a date with Mary and He felt really good, the fact that he was a novice made her more confident to show her true feelings, after they had saw a movie they went to a record store and she bought Charlie a Billy Holiday record for not giving him anything on Christmas. At the end they went to Mary’s house and there was no one there so they started to get a little drunk and they slept almost naked besides the fire. This situation put Charlie really nervous, because he didn’t knew what to do. But in the end Mary’s parents arrived home early before thing get escalated out of control. Letter 35: (28/3/92) Charlie was really upset because he had invited his friends over for dinner but Mary asked if she could come and after all that had happened he couldn’t say no, the problem was that in the dinner he realized that she was a low-self teem egoist person. Since Charlie started dating her people started calling them boyfriends but Charlie didn’t wanted that relationship. It was boring. He sought help in his brother and sister and they both told him to break up. But Charlie didn’t know how. Letter 36: (18/4/92) Charlie messed up thing really bad with his friends. One day after Mary bought him a book and made Charlie show it to his friends he felt wrong, he was so mad that he went to the store and retrieves the money from the book. When he arrived home he felt so terrible for what he had done that he started crying really hard, his sister noticed this and drove him back to the store to get the book again. In this moment Charlie knew his relation with Mary wasn’t normal and that he didn’t want it. But he didn’t know when to tell her about this. So in the worst situation possible, playing truth or dare Patrick asked him to kiss who he thought was the most beautiful girl in the room, he didn’t wanted to lie and kissed Sam. No one expected that so things get awkward quickly. Mary left to the bathroom crying. Sam told him “What the fuck is wrong with you” and Patrick drove him home. He thanked him, and he said there was nothing to thank for, he knew how messy relationships could be. Charlie felt horrible for what he had just done, but he couldn’t bear lying to his friends so he did something “Honest” We still didn’t felt right, and Patrick advised him not to see his friends in a while. . Letter 37: (26/4/92) All that happened after was the distance between Charlie and his friends. Mary was very sad and didn’t want to see him. Sam was also really sensitive because he had problems with Craig and felt sad about being in the middle of ruining Charlie’s relationship with Mary, Patrick was the only one that supported him but he was really busy with Brad to hang out with Charlie. Charlie felt really lost and started smoking pot from Bob. CHAPTER 4 Letter 38: (29/4/92) Charlie is getting really sad because it has being a long time since he felt what having friends feel like and he wants that feeling back. He’s going to the mall and thinking a lot like he used to, asking himself why people went to those places and the story of their lives. He saw Susan on the hallway one day and asked her if he missed Michael. She was speechless and looked at him really weird. Charlie felt weird and the question suddenly was totally out of place. Charlie felt for a time he was a freak, and nobody would like him anymore. Charlie still feels really lost, one time when he went to see Bob for more pot and that’s when he told him about what have really happened with Patrick. Charlie knew that Sam and Mary didn’t wanted to be with him but he didn’t know why Patrick has been evading him. Patrick was actually evading everyone because Brad’s father found them and he started beating Brad really bad. Patrick didn’t know what to do and left, since then he hasn’t been the same person. He evaded not just Charlie but everyone. Also after being throw all those self-stem books Charlie’s sister is dating another guy called Erik, he seems nicer. Charlie missed so much his friends that he secretly watched them perform their play “The rocky horror picture show”. Letter 39: (8/5/92) Charlie’s life get back to normal. This is because Brad finally came to school after being beat up by his father, Charlie was eating when suddenly Patrick passed by and Brad’s friends started molesting him. Brad called him a faggot. He got mad and started a fight with brad that’s when Charlie wanted to help and used his self-defense training. He saved Patrick from getting kicked but got a detention. That day in detention Brad thanked Charlie for helping Patrick, Brad didn’t hated Patrick it’s just that he had to pretend he did. Charlie thought that wasn’t correct. After detention Charlie talked with Sam and she thanked him for helping Patrick, she also said to him that they could be friends again but he needed to say sorry to Mary. Charlie accepted and in the next play he apologized. Mary said it was ok and she had a new boyfriend called Peter (a friend of Craig). Letter 40: (11/5/92) Since the fight Charlie has been hanging out with Patrick a lot more. One night Patrick asked him to go on an adventure in the night and just talked about life, Charlie accepted and they went on to see a movie, got a coffee and finally arrived at a hill in the golf course. They exchanged urban histories, they had a really fun time and at the end when Patrick left Charlie at home he kissed Charlie. Twice, and he apologized for doing it but Charlie didn’t matter he knew what Patrick has been trough and he listened him. Letter 41: (17/5/92) Since that kiss Charlie is going out with Patrick to gay clubs so he can find someone, but he cannot find someone like Brad and this makes him really sad, and at the end the only one there for him is Charlie so every night he tries to kiss him. But one night he saw brad in one of those clubs and Patrick realized that searching that way is stupid. So he drove Charlie home and thanked him for not letting him down. Letter 42: (21/5/92) Charlie is eager to get into vacations since the school year is almost over. Bill was planning to go to New York but he finds teaching really pleasing so he just wants to stay and teach. This time he didn’t give Charlie another book to read but instead he gave him a lot of movies to watch. Charlie is working really hard to get A’s and catching up with the time spent with Patrick. The sad thing is that brad came to school rally depressed after the night in the club. Letter 43: (27/5/92) Charlie thinks about how the prom will on Friday and wonders if he could write a speech on his prom. Letter 44: (2/6/92) The senior joke happened, and his friends already know to what universities they are going. Sam is going the same university that his brother is and if he gets into professional football he should have enough money for getting Charlie into a good university. Charlie likes the book he’s reading and mentions a phrase with a lot of meaning: (I would die for you. But I won’t live for you.) That for Charlie essentially means that it doesn’t matter how much he loves someone, he cannot be dependent. Letter 45: (5/6/92) Charlie had the last day of school and he and all his friends had a great time. They went all to their favorite places and Patrick did his last personification in Mary’s role-play. In Craig’s party Charlie felt really happy and since he didn’t have a partner he sat at the music table and change songs, he felt connected with the people he loved, and he also felt he had been “participating”, having a good social life. Letter 46: (9/6/92) School felt deferent for Charlie because everyone was getting prepared to get out of school into college, Charlie wonders what he would feel when the time comes to him. But he hopes that his friends prom will be great. Letter 47: (10/6/92) Charlie is concentrating on his school grades since he is also getting out of school, strangely he now feels confident and knows he will get straight A’s. He also talked with Bill about him meeting his girlfriend. Letter 48: (13/6/92) The prom day had come and it was actually great for the most part except that Sam and Craig broke up. After the prom Craig paid for a suit for everyone, but Sam’s friends wanted to go to the after-party so the only ones that went to the Suit where Sam and Craig. They actually broke up because the boyfriend of Mary (Peter) Knew that Craig has being cheating on Sam since they started going out. Because Peter was now friends with Sam and he didn’t wanted to get her more hurt he theathen to tell Sam if he didn’t tell her. Craig told her when they were alone in the Suit, Sam got out crying and they haven’t speaker to each other again. Then Peter told Mary that ever if Craig was his friend he would never do that to her. The day after all this happened Charlie went to visit Bill and her girlfriend, they talked about a lot of things and Charlie felt great. Before Charlie left Bill’s house, Bill told him how a great and special person he was for him and that even in he left to New York he considered him a real friend. Letter 49: (16/6/92) Charlie had his last day of school and everyone seemed happy and friendly so he decided to talk to the person that had his locker next to his. The day of the graduation came and Charlie was happy because he saw all his friends and brothers graduate, his father videotape it all. After the graduation Charlie had a family dinner and a friend’s party, in his friend’s party he gave his friends and specially Patrick and Sam a bunch of presents, including his whole collection of books. They were so great full that they drove Charlie for a last ride on the “infinite” tunnel. He tell them how much he would miss them and asked them if they could send letters back and forth Letter 50: (22/6/92) The night before Sam went to collage was bad and good at the same time. Charlie went to their house to help Sam package and them all remembered the good times. Sam then asked Charlie if they could go to their room to package more things. In Sam’s room Sam questioned Charlie why he hadn’t done what he thing was the correct thing to do. Charlie started crying because he realized that all this time he had being a wallflower and a good person but he haven’t being him. Sam asked him to start doing what he really wanted to do and then Charlie and Sam started having sex. But Charlie stopped he didn’t feel ready; he started remembering his aunt Helen. When this happened he panicked and leave Sam’s house. He felt bad for blowing up his opportunity with Sam but at the same time he wanted to get rid of his aunt memories. He went home and tried to forgot everything. EPILOGUE Letter 51: (23/8/92) Charlie tells how everything is better with him now. With the help of his doctor he recovered his personality and gained confidence, he wasn’t afraid or nervous and the panic attacks would never chaise him again. He realized that his aunt abused of him sexually in holidays and Charlie would feel really bad about this but he repressed those memories that returned when Sam tried to have sex with him. Everybody seemed to pay attention to him since then and he promise himself that he could erase his past but he had the power to change his future and keep the relationship he had with his friends. He was going to star his second year in High School and he would do everything he could to make it a better one.</p> </div> <ul class="tags"> <li><a href="/blog/tags/juventud">Juventud</a></li> <li><a
